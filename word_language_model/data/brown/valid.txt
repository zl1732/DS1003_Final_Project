I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off .
<UNK> , it sure <UNK> '' .
`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' .
`` Oh , I'd love to '' .
I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then <UNK> for a few minutes in your tub .
That always <UNK> me .
<UNK> it you '' ? ?
`` Only when I do it '' .
I shook my head .
One of my virtues or <UNK> is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .
`` <UNK> as long as you want , Joyce .
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .
So you'll have everything all to yourself , <UNK> ''
I looked at my watch .
Ten after nine .
Time to go , I supposed .
`` Well , <UNK> '' , I said .
`` <UNK> .
You'd better hurry '' .
`` Oh , you can count on that '' .
She smiled slightly .
<UNK> .
<UNK> .
`` Don't hurry too much .
I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .
That was all she said .
But suddenly those <UNK> eyes seemed to have everything but <UNK> of bees in them .
However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a <UNK> of grim determination , I like to think .
I spun about and <UNK> through the front room to the door .
As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .
Hot water .
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .
Hell , she couldn't .
<UNK> <UNK> Drive is only two or three miles from the <UNK> , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .
But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected .
Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .
<UNK> <UNK> in the big house and surrounding grounds .
I followed a <UNK> gravel path alongside the house to the pool .
Two <UNK> officers , a couple of <UNK> I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .
At the <UNK> far end was the little <UNK> Joyce had mentioned , and on the <UNK> surface <UNK> scattered <UNK> patches of <UNK> <UNK> .
A few yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green <UNK> .
Lieutenant <UNK> , one of the <UNK> , spotted me and said , `` <UNK> , <UNK> '' , and walked toward me .
`` <UNK> you hear about this one '' ? ?
I grinned , but ignored the question .
He didn't push it ; ;
<UNK> worked out of Central <UNK> and we'd been friends for years .
He filled me in .
A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now .
<UNK> at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been <UNK> partner Bill <UNK> , and <UNK> Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the <UNK> account .
Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the <UNK> session earlier .
`` What were they doing here '' ? ?
I asked <UNK> .
`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine <UNK> for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this <UNK> stuff '' .
`` Yeah , I've heard more about <UNK> than space exploration lately .
What is the <UNK> '' ? ?
`` How would I know ? ?
It's a secret .
That was the new advertising angle -- something about a <UNK> of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret <UNK> .
Actually , only two men know what the formula is , <UNK> and '' -- He stopped and looked at <UNK> body .
I said , `` <UNK> , so now only <UNK> knows .
How's it strike you , <UNK> or fair '' ? ?
`` Can't say yet .
<UNK> <UNK> says it looks like he <UNK> in a big pile of those thick suds and <UNK> on 'em .
The <UNK> might show he <UNK> instead , but that's what the <UNK> gives us .
<UNK> , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' .
`` I'll pick murder .
Anything else '' ? ?
`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a <UNK> pole from the <UNK> locker and started <UNK> him out .
Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ;
this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife .
If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been <UNK> on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ;
those who wrote them knew people and what made people <UNK> .
I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild <UNK> of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , the old French <UNK> .
The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day .
The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .
I had a <UNK> studio which <UNK> an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming <UNK> in the southern sun .
I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after <UNK> college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there .
When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted .
The arrangement turned out to be excellent .
I loved the city and I particularly loved the <UNK> and spirit of <UNK> <UNK> .
I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another <UNK> , <UNK> celebration with romance in the air ; ;
and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of <UNK> eyes were waiting around the next corner .
The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .
It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with <UNK> and go <UNK> .
My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .
Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything .
One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .
They were married over the <UNK> , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .
She looked more like twenty-five or six .
It was really a May and December combination .
My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as <UNK> a woman who <UNK> sex .
There was something about the <UNK> of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans <UNK> , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not <UNK> me .
Her legs were the full , <UNK> kind , full <UNK> like a rare wine and just as <UNK> to the appetite ; ;
the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect .
You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .
The true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can <UNK> an <UNK> entire body .
The artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a <UNK> and , in his <UNK> eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .
And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .
That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly <UNK> them .
I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly <UNK> her cheeks .
True , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care .
She was standing with her back to the glass door .
Her form was <UNK> and with the strong light I could see the <UNK> of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .
As it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something <UNK> .
Something <UNK> in this instance , but I treated her <UNK> and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance .
When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was <UNK> lest my Uncle notice it .
And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me <UNK> .
I felt that her eyes were <UNK> me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .
I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .
When our eyes met the air was filled with an <UNK> message of `` Me , too '' .
You have probably experienced this .
It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly <UNK> with a high charge of electricity .
Why she married him I do not know .
I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me .
He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who <UNK> the <UNK> of living .
Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ;
some women with father <UNK> do .
For several weeks we <UNK> one another almost like <UNK> partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly <UNK> and stayed home ; ;
his bride opened the store .
I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my <UNK> <UNK> .
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a <UNK> flush that <UNK> her neck and moved <UNK> to her cheeks , and <UNK> I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .
The <UNK> depth , <UNK> with <UNK> , <UNK> to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk .
She placed her <UNK> , fingers <UNK> , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next '' ? ?
I was aware of a <UNK> look in her eyes that told me the time was <UNK> .
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
I was standing beside her , watching the <UNK> <UNK> and wondering about the old <UNK> <UNK> against the wall on which he sometimes <UNK> .
I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms <UNK> me in a <UNK> <UNK> .
Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender .
I heard her <UNK> , `` We'd better lock the door '' .
It did not take me long to slip the bolt <UNK> and return to the rear and its couch .
When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said :
`` He will not always be <UNK> '' .
`` I know .
I was thinking about that .
How will we work it out '' ? ?
`` I don't know '' , she said .
`` You're the man .
You figure it out .
I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' .
`` I guess we both felt it '' .
I said .
`` I guess so '' , she said .
`` But now what '' ? ?
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be <UNK> .
`` I know what we can do '' , I said .
`` Tell him I made a pass at you '' .
She raised a <UNK> hand with a startled air .
`` What are you trying to do ? ?
Get thrown out ? ?
If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? ?
`` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will .
I think I have a way so we can carry on without his <UNK> us '' .
`` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ?
She said <UNK> .
`` When I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class .
I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or <UNK> century poets .
In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some <UNK> to tell ; ;
and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> opens officially .
A lot of people will <UNK> the streets in costumes and <UNK> , and having a ball .
There will be romance and <UNK> .
If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you <UNK> something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a <UNK> I really am .
We made a <UNK> tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake <UNK> .
And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
You are both the same size .
He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy <UNK> for a mask .
When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' .
`` But you '' -- she began .
`` Don't worry about me .
It will turn out all right '' .
`` I don't understand '' , she insisted .
`` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ?
`` No '' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' .
As we expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning .
I felt that he looked at me <UNK> and <UNK> and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife .
I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .
I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French <UNK> after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .
Shortly before nine I drove my <UNK> to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the <UNK> corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .
A few minutes later I saw my <UNK> car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner .
I must say the figure was well made up .
If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him .
In one hand he gripped firmly a <UNK> though there had been no indication of rain .
I suspected why he brought it along .
In the half darkness I approached <UNK> , making sure he did not see me .
He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without <UNK> words I <UNK> him hard across the face .
`` You cheap <UNK> '' ! !
I exclaimed .
`` You cheap , no good , <UNK> <UNK> ! !
You get a good , loyal husband -- <UNK> ! !
-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! !
You should -- <UNK> ! !
-- be ashamed of yourself .
He had better write a <UNK> to Walter .
He opened the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to Robert <UNK> imaginative interpretation of the creation of the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> ) were the names of four <UNK> bars and Meredith <UNK> address .
The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret <UNK> .
The code , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use .
A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something .
Nicolas called on his <UNK> , a line came back :
`` <UNK> , man , and all the <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> '' .
That ought to draw a laugh , Nicolas <UNK> , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind .
And indeed , his <UNK> did draw from Walter a letter <UNK> his friend , the poet Nicolas <UNK> , to his friend Meredith <UNK> .
Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat <UNK> his <UNK> on his writing table .
<UNK> ! !
He <UNK> cried .
His hand was large and square and heavily <UNK> .
The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt .
His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months .
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
Now , he was just in the late poems of <UNK> and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next <UNK> class preparation .
He was determined to spend an <UNK> summer .
Well , maybe <UNK> wouldn't call .
<UNK> fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him : <UNK> <UNK> , die <UNK> <UNK> .
The menace of <UNK> gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark <UNK> laughed ' ? ?
Or , more <UNK> , ' The <UNK> <UNK> are laughing ' ? ?
And he missed the point that the <UNK> <UNK> might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas <UNK> .
But Nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning .
Not by the <UNK> sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ;
but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and <UNK> regarded him .
Should she wake him ? ?
She didn't have the heart .
Her heart , her <UNK> feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly <UNK> by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from <UNK> .
She was just not able to break the spell .
( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of <UNK> marked bars ? ?
Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?
So if all these <UNK> was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' .
Ballet dancer : <UNK> , tears , and `` take what you want , Nicolas , I am a dancer , you are a poet , it is all beautiful '' .
To this <UNK> <UNK> Nicolas had replied , `` <UNK> I can use this blanket .
And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can <UNK> something to eat '' .
And , as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that <UNK> early mornings even in summer are <UNK> with <UNK> .
He had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms .
He used the blanket for late morning <UNK> when <UNK> of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions .
Mary Jane <UNK> knew none of this .
) Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a <UNK> , black hair falling over his eyes .
She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .
This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised .
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in <UNK> had opened her eyes .
His advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had <UNK> his hair -- this was all new .
Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith .
The next day he was gone .
Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined .
Even so , it took her several days to force Walter to tell her <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> a small suitcase , <UNK> her husband whom she found in <UNK> Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while , <UNK> his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours .
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens .
`` <UNK> girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens '' .
`` How like him '' ! !
Mary Jane had <UNK> said .
`` His address '' , Walter added , `` is that great <UNK> home , the American <UNK> .
And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband .
'' For the last half hour Mary Jane had <UNK> half the length of the Gardens and , at last , come upon her <UNK> .
His presence there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the <UNK> of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels .
She set down her suitcase .
Should she wake him ? ?
No .
<UNK> , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched .
The sun grew <UNK> as it approached the <UNK> .
Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the <UNK> of a <UNK> car .
He began <UNK> .
In his dream he cried , `` <UNK> down , for <UNK> '' ! !
He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass .
His nose was <UNK> .
He <UNK> .
He blew his nose <UNK> between his fingers .
He spit .
He half sat up and <UNK> at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs .
He <UNK> , he stretched .
Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away .
<UNK> minutes later she was at the desk of the <UNK> pension , her tears dried , <UNK> a hotel form and asking for a bath .
Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and <UNK> in all the major and minor cities .
She had retreated to this world .
The <UNK> , who was <UNK> by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair .
<UNK> are very interesting .
Nevertheless , there is no bath .
But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once .
And then we shall see .
'' ( The <UNK> was partial to the word shall .
)
Meredith was <UNK> when the <UNK> knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty ! !
Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?
Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe .
You shall see her at dinner '' .
Rather <UNK> he listened to the bath water running ; ;
when it stopped he began <UNK> <UNK> , sitting up in a <UNK> way .
Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .
A thing he did not like doing , generally .
<UNK> into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun <UNK> .
He <UNK> his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew <UNK> of <UNK> as he washed .
In the small gallery used as the <UNK> dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began <UNK> the young <UNK> .
He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the <UNK> followed by a <UNK> blond girl approaching his table .
It would be literary license calculated to <UNK> life to say that he , oh , dropped his <UNK> , so startled was he by Mary <UNK> beauty .
Yet he did drop his <UNK> with the ordinary country girl as much in <UNK> to the <UNK> as <UNK> that here , indeed , was something special .
Mary Jane had made very little effort .
Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green <UNK> sweater with , as he soon perceived , no <UNK> beneath .
Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders .
Perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day .
She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip <UNK> which made her lips <UNK> but no <UNK> than usual .
The result was grace and <UNK> .
As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with <UNK> of intelligence and control .
Meredith began falling in love .
<UNK> : `` Only this morning '' ; ;
<UNK> <UNK> : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! !
; ;
<UNK> : `` Then you were <UNK> poems this afternoon '' ? ?
; ;
<UNK> <UNK> : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ;
a smile .
`` What a beautiful room .
Like as if it were built of books '' .
Having opened the windows onto the <UNK> , lit the fire , translated the <UNK> , Meredith grinned and took down a little <UNK> of books bound together in old <UNK> .
<UNK> these he brought out a <UNK> bottle and small gold <UNK> glasses hidden inside it .
`` I think the maids <UNK> in the afternoon '' .
`` Those sweet girls ? ?
Oh you're <UNK> .
It tastes a little like <UNK> .
What's its name ? ?
<UNK> '' She whispered <UNK> to herself , several times , <UNK> it .
`` Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? ?
<UNK> voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ;
in reading , on <UNK> , even in the large <UNK> of the <UNK> , <UNK> Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .
His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .
The husband points the steps out with his <UNK> : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind <UNK> with appetite , <UNK> her hands that <UNK> my <UNK> And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes <UNK> all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was <UNK> at this line , or was it the fire ? ?
) But he read on .
In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic <UNK> I watch her staring face , still blind , Start <UNK> in obedience To dirty waters , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> below stairs , in her mind '' .
Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words .
`` Oh , it's that myth , about <UNK> and What is her name ? ?
I can never <UNK> it '' .
She repeated `` <UNK> '' .
The third time rather <UNK> .
But with her hand poem again .
She raised her face and nodded , `` It's sweet , and very sad '' .
They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds .
They finished the small bottle of <UNK> .
She <UNK> she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ?
She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please don't judge all poets '' .
They smiled .
At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' .
<UNK> her he whispered , several times , `` <UNK> '' .
The third time rather <UNK> .
But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , <UNK> , and finally <UNK> <UNK> with the feel of her hand against his mouth .
They were west of the <UNK> , but only God knew where .
For three days , their <UNK> oxen had <UNK> up a <UNK> valley as flat and <UNK> as a dead sea .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> an angry <UNK> ; ;
<UNK> air <UNK> their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ;
dust <UNK> their <UNK> and lay like acid in their lungs .
And the valley stretched <UNK> out ahead , <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> in its heat , until it vanished into the <UNK> wall of <UNK> orange brown <UNK> .
Ben <UNK> extended his <UNK> stride until he could lay his <UNK> across the <UNK> of the oxen .
`` <UNK> '' ! !
He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .
He removed his hat to let the <UNK> sweat cut <UNK> through the dust film upon his <UNK> face .
He spat .
The <UNK> <UNK> came from his mouth like <UNK> cotton .
He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , <UNK> the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his <UNK> <UNK> .
The burning air dried his <UNK> clothes in <UNK> patches .
He cleared his throat and wet his lips .
As <UNK> as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' .
He <UNK> the <UNK> and drew water from a barrel .
They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by <UNK> .
The water was warm and <UNK> and had a <UNK> taste .
But it was water .
Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !
He <UNK> his mouth with a small quantity .
He took a long but carefully controlled <UNK> .
He <UNK> the <UNK> and handed it to his young wife riding the <UNK> deck .
She took it <UNK> , her dark eyes <UNK> as they met his .
She drank and pushed back her <UNK> <UNK> to wet a <UNK> and wipe her face .
She set the <UNK> on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on <UNK> .
`` What happens when there's no more water '' ? ?
She asked <UNK> .
She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , <UNK> , explosive .
Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .
Her temper <UNK> like charcoal when it first lights up .
And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not <UNK> .
A <UNK> ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .
`` There must be some water under there '' .
He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .
`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .
`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?
She <UNK> .
`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? ?
`` We can boil it '' , he said .
Her chin <UNK> .
`` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out <UNK> .
`` The tires are <UNK> on the wheels now .
They'll roll off in another day .
There was no valley like this on your map .
You don't even know where we're headed '' .
`` <UNK> '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west .
Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' .
`` Somewhere ! !
'' She repeated .
`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our <UNK> '' .
His wide mouth compressed .
In a way , he couldn't blame her .
He had picked out this <UNK> trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon .
It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .
It wasn't the <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> of the trip that had frightened her .
She had hated the whole idea before they started .
Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him .
It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a <UNK> of <UNK> , administered by her mother .
The bitterness of their wedding night still <UNK> within him like an open wound .
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a <UNK> .
He had left her <UNK> , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time .
But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .
He stared at the <UNK> , turning it over and over in his wide , <UNK> hands .
`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .
`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !
Her laugh was hard .
`` They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if <UNK> been food enough to go around '' .
He <UNK> .
`` <UNK> , they didn't sell you '' , he said <UNK> .
`` They knew I was a good <UNK> farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own .
They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them .
Without money or property , what would you have had at <UNK> <UNK> '' ? ?
`` I might have <UNK> , but at least I wouldn't be <UNK> to a crisp and <UNK> with dirt '' ! !
He <UNK> under his heavy burn .
His blue eyes sought the <UNK> sea of <UNK> ahead .
To his <UNK> , there suddenly was no <UNK> .
The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the <UNK> line of <UNK> , <UNK> hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .
Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , <UNK> clouds that formed even as they <UNK> over the <UNK> of the surrounding hills .
He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a <UNK> in Carolina .
He <UNK> <UNK> , `` <UNK> on '' ! !
And <UNK> the oxen as he yelled .
He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm .
Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of <UNK> ground , instead of <UNK> a grade or ridge .
He swung up over the wheel .
`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .
But she sat on in stubborn silence .
The clouds <UNK> downward and burst suddenly into a great black <UNK> .
<UNK> , they stared at it whirling down the valley , <UNK> and <UNK> out <UNK> and <UNK> of earth like a <UNK> <UNK> dog cracking <UNK> .
The <UNK> <UNK> began to whip and shake .
Their world turned black .
It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence .
The heavens opened , <UNK> them with <UNK> the size of <UNK> .
And then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that <UNK> down like water <UNK> from a <UNK> .
<UNK> of water rushed down the <UNK> and filled the <UNK> like the <UNK> of flash <UNK> .
Through the <UNK> of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it <UNK> through its <UNK> , <UNK> big <UNK> out of the banks .
The <UNK> , <UNK> surface of the river reached the level of the <UNK> .
The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising .
They <UNK> under <UNK> covers , listening to the waves <UNK> against the bottom .
The <UNK> cut off abruptly .
They were <UNK> by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry <UNK> of the river .
Then the darkness <UNK> , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .
<UNK> with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the <UNK> deck and looked out <UNK> at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills .
The water level was higher than their <UNK> .
Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .
There was no real sign of the river now , just a <UNK> , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .
<UNK> of brush rode down the ribbon .
Now and then , the <UNK> side of a <UNK> object showed as it swept past .
The girl crawled out into the <UNK> warmth of the <UNK> , <UNK> her shoulders and still trembling .
Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes <UNK> with blame for Ben .
Out of <UNK> to say something <UNK> , Ben <UNK> <UNK> , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first <UNK> hit .
At least , the wheels dug in .
The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .
She was watching a tree ride wildly down that <UNK> current .
Somebody was riding the tree .
It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting <UNK> an upright branch .
She did not call out .
But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell .
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .
It <UNK> up into the air , then <UNK> back , the <UNK> branch turned slowly .
The pale <UNK> of the woman disappeared .
`` There's the one who's lucky '' ! !
The girl murmured <UNK> .
<UNK> eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and <UNK> .
Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the <UNK> , <UNK> their comfort more than they needed his .
It was nearly <UNK> and he went to the back of the wagon , <UNK> his way , for he was not a tall man .
He let down the <UNK> and was knocked over by the <UNK> of water .
He <UNK> back to his feet and scrambled <UNK> to pull his bags of seed grain forward .
They were already swollen to bursting .
Of all their worldly <UNK> , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most <UNK> .
It was <UNK> now for seed , and it would <UNK> and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it .
The oxen might as well enjoy it .
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .
The waters lay muddy but <UNK> , without a <UNK> of movement against the wheels ; ;
there was not a <UNK> of damp mark to show they were <UNK> .
He doubted if a man could <UNK> as far as the <UNK> , dry hills that <UNK> the valley .
A terrible , <UNK> sense of <UNK> swept over him .
He gripped the wheel hard to fight the <UNK> of defeat .
Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .
The <UNK> were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .
Hope <UNK> within him .
He swung toward the front to give the news to <UNK> , then stopped , <UNK> from her by the <UNK> of her blame and hate .
Still , he felt better .
A tight wagon meant so much .
He got a small fire started and put on <UNK> and coffee .
He poured the water off the <UNK> and off the <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> of a sort .
Their <UNK> and <UNK> had not suffered .
He found a jar of preserved <UNK> and one of eggs that they had meant to save .
Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might <UNK> this depression <UNK> <UNK> .
His long nose <UNK> at the smells of <UNK> <UNK> and heating <UNK> , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time .
He <UNK> the slashed sides of the canvas <UNK> , leaving the ribs and wagon open .
He looked thoughtfully at his wife's <UNK> , holding her <UNK> <UNK> .
He said <UNK> , `` <UNK> , I don't figure your things got wet too much .
That's a good <UNK> .
If you want to get them <UNK> ''
She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in <UNK> the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be <UNK> '' .
He drew a long breath and opened the <UNK> and hung out her clothes and <UNK> upon the wagon ribs .
<UNK> , oil , and <UNK> make the kind of <UNK> any <UNK> dreams of .
I suppose a <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> a cigarette in the hold and touched off the <UNK> .
Now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the <UNK> heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like <UNK> sheep , not knowing what to do .
The <UNK> were stuck fast .
We couldn't <UNK> them .
I heard a cry from a <UNK> as a <UNK> of flame leaped from a <UNK> and <UNK> the man's bare back .
He <UNK> to the rail and leaped overboard into the <UNK> waters .
One especially bad <UNK> shook <UNK> No. 3 which <UNK> violently in the <UNK> .
Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , <UNK> , Max step on it , we got a chance now .
<UNK> on those <UNK> ; ;
the <UNK> come <UNK> '' .
We pulled and swore and <UNK> and wept , <UNK> our hands until they <UNK> <UNK> .
The <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> like an old <UNK> mare .
Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the <UNK> which dropped heavily into the water .
Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and <UNK> to the boat .
`` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his <UNK> of <UNK> hair .
`` That tub is going to <UNK> all at once '' .
Then the <UNK> seemed to <UNK> with a roar of live steam , <UNK> of <UNK> and flames , and a dense cloud of <UNK> smoke .
<UNK> , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that <UNK> .
Already our <UNK> <UNK> was filled with five inches of water .
`` <UNK> , you <UNK> while we row '' , Brassnose commanded .
As best as I could determine , we were some <UNK> miles west of New <UNK> , in the <UNK> <UNK> .
Three days previously , we had <UNK> past <UNK> <UNK> Island in the distance .
Now we peered anxiously for any <UNK> of land in the Pacific , for this <UNK> <UNK> would have to stop soon .
There were gigantic <UNK> and rope burns on our hands ; ;
our muscles were hot wires of pain .
Brassnose was <UNK> silent .
The big man with the <UNK> hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the <UNK> tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my <UNK> 6 , class at the University of Chicago .
He then said something which struck a <UNK> in my memory .
`` God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga .
We'd be in real trouble then .
I'd rather keep <UNK> -- or sink '' .
I was puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard <UNK> three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies .
He had been speaking of this <UNK> :
`` Even when the islands were under German <UNK> before World War 1 , , <UNK> gave Eromonga a wide <UNK> .
The place is <UNK> by several hundred <UNK> women who are <UNK> of the <UNK> Century -- stone age <UNK> who live in an <UNK> , <UNK> society which is <UNK> '' .
I remembered , too , the <UNK> voice of a <UNK> , Bobby <UNK> : `` But how do they <UNK> , Dr. <UNK> ? ?
I'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! !
There had been classroom <UNK> which quickly <UNK> as Professor <UNK> said <UNK> : `` I see your point , <UNK> .
Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga .
Indeed , you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after <UNK> them for <UNK> purposes , or they destroy them by <UNK> but ingenious methods .
In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the <UNK> of men '' .
`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said .
`` I know something about Eromonga .
Let's hope we come to a <UNK> place '' .
But we didn't .
Three hours later , while we were <UNK> desperately , a dot of land came into view .
Foster <UNK> <UNK> made a sign over his heart with his two linked <UNK> : I recognized it as an ancient <UNK> gesture intended to <UNK> the <UNK> .
A <UNK> passed ; ;
we had drifted closer .
In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big <UNK> mate <UNK> :
`` <UNK> ! !
It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden <UNK> on the <UNK> '' .
I <UNK> at the looming <UNK> .
There was a wooden tower or <UNK> there , something like a <UNK> jump ; ;
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been <UNK> constructed of <UNK> .
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .
`` What is the <UNK> for , Brassnose '' ? ?
He made a sound of despair deep in his throat .
It was embarrassing to see <UNK> , blonde Brassnose <UNK> himself like a child who talks about <UNK> .
`` <UNK> ! !
It is their <UNK> , the ' jumping platform ' of death .
It is the last of the three tests of <UNK> which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there .
Often , I heard my <UNK> and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in <UNK> .
They had never seen a <UNK> but they had heard about it from their fathers '' .
Our <UNK> was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful <UNK> manned by three <UNK> girls <UNK> out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .
I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of <UNK> in his blood -- to speak to them .
But he had turned a <UNK> green and appeared <UNK> or <UNK> .
So , I <UNK> my few words of the <UNK> dialect and said , `` We <UNK> you in peace .
In <UNK> .
My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .
We are <UNK> and hungry ; ;
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' .
The girl in the <UNK> of the <UNK> turned a smile like a <UNK> on me .
I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a <UNK> of red <UNK> fruit in her <UNK> hair .
She said , `` My name is <UNK> and these girls are <UNK> and <UNK> .
You are welcome to Eromonga .
My people await you on the shore .
You shall have food , water and rest '' .
<UNK> minutes later , the <UNK> <UNK> on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with <UNK> <UNK> to a large <UNK> .
I saw a dozen or so other <UNK> <UNK> there .
I looked .
All my <UNK> <UNK> of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight .
There was a mound of <UNK> human bones and <UNK> at the base of the big wooden <UNK> .
Some had been there for years ; ;
others still had <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> flesh <UNK> to them .
There was one object which <UNK> yet <UNK> me .
This was also a <UNK> -- a male , judging from the <UNK> arm bands , the <UNK> scars still <UNK> on the <UNK> face , the painted bone of the <UNK> <UNK> which still <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> nose .
The body may have been two or three <UNK> dead .
I looked with <UNK> at the legs .
They were shattered .
Many small bones <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> of flesh .
The man must have leaped to his death from the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> .
As if <UNK> my thoughts , the girl <UNK> smiled <UNK> and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden :
`` This is our <UNK> , a jumping platform , <UNK> .
Later , you shall know it better .
Is it not <UNK> ? ?
Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the <UNK> festival fifteen <UNK> ago .
It took thirty of our women almost six <UNK> to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .
We are very proud of it '' .
`` You have every right to be '' , I replied <UNK> in the <UNK> dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .
He looked as if he was going to <UNK> over .
I felt a <UNK> in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid .
Not so soon , anyway .
I <UNK> the big man with the <UNK> hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the <UNK> <UNK> .
He speaks your language too , for he is the <UNK> of a <UNK> on <UNK> who made much magic and was strong and <UNK> .
The <UNK> <UNK> has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' .
This was the worst thing I could have said .
Brassnose turned a <UNK> face toward me and said <UNK> , `` <UNK> , you <UNK> <UNK> , you're a fool ! !
They <UNK> males who <UNK> of their strength ; ;
they destroy such men with their damned tests .
You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !
At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this .
But a glance at <UNK> and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had <UNK> out .
The women's faces had hardened after my statement .
At a nod from <UNK> , four <UNK> and muscular girls <UNK> to <UNK> side and seized him by the arms .
The man was an <UNK> and he put up a <UNK> struggle ; ;
but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .
Besides , terror had <UNK> some of <UNK> vitality and will .
My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
.
In the <UNK> tongue , `` <UNK> '' means <UNK> -- a quality which the women <UNK> <UNK> in weekly <UNK> at which great quantities of a <UNK> like <UNK> were <UNK> .
In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled <UNK> with bare <UNK> breasts who seemed to enjoy <UNK> with me in <UNK> phrases .
Her name was <UNK> and she told me many things .
For an <UNK> , <UNK> old <UNK> was a mine of information .
Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .
( Her account was later confirmed by the <UNK> <UNK> from the University of <UNK> in 1951 .
)
From <UNK> , I heard that until about <UNK> the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of <UNK> tribes was observed here with minor variations .
But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` <UNK> '' seized a <UNK> in the heat of an <UNK> battle and <UNK> the women after their men had fled .
<UNK> , <UNK> and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred <UNK> from the <UNK> of <UNK> back to their war <UNK> , after considerable loss of life on both sides .
<UNK> was something of a politician as well as a <UNK> .
She quickly exploited the <UNK> position she now occupied , by <UNK> the <UNK> males and even putting many of them to death .
Within a decade or less , few men were left and a <UNK> society had sprung up .
`` <UNK> was great <UNK> , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the <UNK> told me .
`` All men went away from here .
Those who stayed had to pass tests .
Few passed '' .
She <UNK> with <UNK> , showing the <UNK> of <UNK> teeth .
`` <UNK> women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- <UNK> -- for just the strongest men could stay here .
Come , I show you '' .
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .
In the shade of a palm tree in front of the <UNK> dwelling I saw four figures in a <UNK> on the ground .
`` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home .
Maybe to beat up on his <UNK> '' .
Benson looked up and saw <UNK> long head <UNK> forward to <UNK> his chin on the stiff edge of the overall <UNK> .
Ramey reached out with the tire iron and <UNK> a <UNK> of mud that was <UNK> on the spare tire rack .
`` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' .
Somehow the thought of a simple man <UNK> by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver .
For a moment his hatred toward <UNK> or <UNK> drivers <UNK> .
Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought .
Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us .
Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .
`` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , <UNK> '' ? ?
He said to his partner .
`` You mean dream '' ? ?
`` Not exactly .
Just see it '' .
Benson grinned and <UNK> a rock with his thumb like a marble .
`` <UNK> , just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner '' .
Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .
Never <UNK> .
Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .
With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .
`` You seen him yet '' ? ?
Benson said , referring to the Indian .
`` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said .
`` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said .
`` If you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the <UNK> of the car '' .
`` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .
A few minutes later the insurance man , a road <UNK> , drove up in the gray <UNK> with license plates on it from a <UNK> state .
It was a trick they used to try and <UNK> their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .
Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .
All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big <UNK> straw hat with <UNK> edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out <UNK> <UNK> cane .
<UNK> , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .
It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to <UNK> himself as a tourist , an <UNK> driver like <UNK> would merely pick something <UNK> and put it on his head .
The insurance man informed them that he had talked to <UNK> who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they <UNK> the <UNK> back to town .
He <UNK> with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the <UNK> shade of the trailer .
Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the <UNK> then <UNK> up again as it got clear .
When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .
`` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped .
She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .
She wore shorts and a loose <UNK> shirt .
<UNK> and <UNK> , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .
`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?
Benson said .
Seeing her caused a <UNK> in Ramey , a recognition .
She might have been someone he had once loved .
He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .
The truck <UNK> , the industrial areas with walls <UNK> with <UNK> smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back <UNK> were their access to a city and they could never stay .
How would you ever see her again ? ?
The feeling <UNK> , it was only a small <UNK> .
Their work was lonely .
`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?
Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .
The girl looked around at the <UNK> .
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .
It made only a tiny <UNK> over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .
She began to watch a <UNK> man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the <UNK> car in the one spot that most of the crowd had <UNK> slightly .
What had caught his attention was <UNK> by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .
The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that <UNK> <UNK> Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , <UNK> '' .
The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .
The man stood near the bent <UNK> body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .
The two drivers moved closer .
`` What does he want , a <UNK> '' ? ?
Benson said to Ramey .
One tiny detail in a happening can <UNK> the memory and stick like meat in a <UNK> tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go <UNK> and uncertain .
With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was <UNK> the <UNK> foot that he would always remember .
The <UNK> were broken at the bottom of the <UNK> but there was still a bow <UNK> at the top .
The slightest <UNK> would have <UNK> the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .
The two men in <UNK> stood just behind the <UNK> man .
He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the <UNK> .
He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , <UNK> eyes .
He was very <UNK> -- big hands might have torn him from a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` He's dead , isn't he '' ? ?
The man said .
He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .
There was nothing in particular on the man's face .
It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .
`` What's this '' ? ?
The man said , <UNK> up a step , still looking down .
His words were mostly to himself .
`` Don't '' .
There was a gentle concern in <UNK> voice .
Ramey looked down and saw the white <UNK> at the bottom of the man's <UNK> leg <UNK> <UNK> a bit of folded , <UNK> substance lying by itself on the pavement .
`` But what is it '' ? ?
The man said with a tone of impatience .
But what is it ? ?
The man had spoken only once .
Ramey heard the words again inside , <UNK> , the way moving water sounds through a <UNK> of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or <UNK> pressing in his ears .
The <UNK> reached out once more to tap against the mass and <UNK> vision <UNK> except for an <UNK> clarity of the man's leg .
Ramey saw sunlight touch the <UNK> blonde hairs on the brown skin .
He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , <UNK> .
<UNK> brains '' .
The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .
Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .
It was a straight , solid , <UNK> shot ; ;
he laid all four <UNK> in between the man's <UNK> and his chin .
<UNK> fist and the air <UNK> from the man's <UNK> cheek made a hollow <UNK> in the air like <UNK> hands <UNK> together .
The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .
Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .
As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .
He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .
With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .
His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .
After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to <UNK> from it .
The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers <UNK> across his face until he touched his mouth .
He <UNK> and pulled the hand away .
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .
Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .
He did not look around .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Someone said .
`` He's hurt '' ! !
A woman's voice said , and then he heard a sort of <UNK> from the man's wife .
The man on the ground began to move ; ;
one of his hands <UNK> out on the pavement and supported him .
<UNK> <UNK> down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran <UNK> across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V <UNK> into the <UNK> had melted , running a <UNK> color .
The girl <UNK> by her husband with one arm at his back .
`` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ?
She begged .
An <UNK> , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .
The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
Then she saw Ramey and her face was <UNK> with <UNK> .
`` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ?
She said , her voice rising .
Ramey said nothing .
A <UNK> in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .
Behind Ramey feet <UNK> beneath sharp questioning <UNK> .
No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .
Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the <UNK> truck talking to the <UNK> .
Benson moved his arms , <UNK> with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .
Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .
Some of the <UNK> was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .
It's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the <UNK> turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .
Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the <UNK> on the metal sides of the trailer .
He saw the dark sweat spots <UNK> in and out of sight under the <UNK> swinging arms and in the leather holster that <UNK> and rolled at the side of his <UNK> body , the sun left a <UNK> <UNK> on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the <UNK> handles of his pistol .
`` All right , step back '' ! !
The <UNK> said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in <UNK> .
He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .
`` You all right '' ? ?
`` <UNK> -- it's my <UNK> '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .
His brown face looked gray from dirt <UNK> where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .
Then he calmly and carefully <UNK> the remaining five shots into the <UNK> head -- caught in the <UNK> back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the <UNK> .
The body continued to <UNK> , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the <UNK> , <UNK> mass out of the <UNK> .
He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , <UNK> at the sound of the shots .
He heard their <UNK> , and then the sounds of <UNK> as they <UNK> the snake right on the porch with wood <UNK> .
It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .
She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .
The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , <UNK> into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .
But her hands were calm , now .
She's got guts , thought Keith .
She's got more guts than any other woman in the world .
`` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful .
I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .
Thank you , Keith '' .
He smiled at her sincerity .
And for the <UNK> time that week , he was startled at her beauty .
<UNK> .
Seven years they'd been married .
He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and <UNK> , its painful insistence on truth and <UNK> , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to <UNK> , even in part .
But her beauty always surprised him <UNK> .
`` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith .
`` But knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .
Isn't that so '' ? ?
Penny lowered her eyes .
`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if <UNK> to a crime .
`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?
Asked Keith , his voice getting <UNK> in spite of himself , as he <UNK> to control his growing anger .
`` It was a king <UNK> , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? ?
didn't it ? ?
''
Penny did not answer .
Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .
`` We're all God's creatures , aren't we '' ? ?
Keith was <UNK> now .
`` All of us -- every <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and killer in that jungle .
You love this village and these <UNK> brown people because they're God's creatures , too .
And you love <UNK> , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he's a beautiful man .
And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman .
We're all God's creatures , aren't we , Penny ? ?
All of us , that is , except me .
You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to <UNK> .
You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that <UNK> snake .
Well , why don't you say something '' ? ?
Penny would not rise to his mood .
`` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?
She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the <UNK> .
He knew she was not <UNK> , not even angry at him .
Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .
The <UNK> has its <UNK> in the <UNK> of the world , the towering white <UNK> of the <UNK> that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .
For a brief period each year , the <UNK> of the sun are warm enough to <UNK> some of the <UNK> piled a mile deep at the base of the <UNK> , and then the <UNK> <UNK> in the daytime at high noon , and <UNK> of <UNK> of water begin their slow <UNK> under the <UNK> and across the <UNK> hanging <UNK> on their long , <UNK> journey to the sea -- running east past the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , then turning south and <UNK> down through the <UNK> of <UNK> , past the <UNK> Hills , and into <UNK> , past <UNK> and <UNK> , until the hard water of the melting <UNK> <UNK> with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to <UNK> with the <UNK> salt depths of the Bay of <UNK> .
Keith <UNK> had looked down on the <UNK> more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the <UNK> of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .
But Keith looked down more than up .
He thought of the <UNK> below him , and of the wild , strange , <UNK> beauty there and he promised himself that <UNK> he would return , on foot perhaps , to <UNK> in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the <UNK> , and animals the <UNK> .
At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .
But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .
<UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .
And <UNK> record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man <UNK> , who might even survive .
He became a fighter pilot after the <UNK> over the <UNK> in the big <UNK> .
The <UNK> was <UNK> weapon of <UNK> , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .
He knew how to shoot down Nazis .
And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the <UNK> on it -- because he was <UNK> incapable of fear .
That was true , but only half the truth .
The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself .
He enjoyed the killing .
Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .
He enjoyed killing .
And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .
<UNK> , we talk as though the <UNK> were just a short <UNK> .
The Nazis <UNK> Britain , so the <UNK> <UNK> and shot them all down .
Not quite .
It was a war of nerves , of <UNK> , of <UNK> endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an <UNK> obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and <UNK> superior .
It took a long time before the British <UNK> the balance .
Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be <UNK> .
They <UNK> him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices .
That was where he met Penny .
He was aware of her as a <UNK> <UNK> American <UNK> , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all .
Penny knew him better , on her part .
He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without <UNK> .
They don't go for <UNK> muscle , as a rule .
He had strength in his <UNK> frame , but it was like the <UNK> steel in a <UNK> .
He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of <UNK> that give away the power in <UNK> and <UNK> .
His hair was black , already <UNK> at the <UNK> in the classic <UNK> , the only one permitted to a man .
The pretty little <UNK> <UNK> said he had the look of <UNK> -- and Penny , <UNK> the <UNK> , had to admit that in this case it applied .
Keith was an <UNK> .
Penny and Keith had no romance .
No dates or <UNK> .
But they met in one <UNK> moment that gave them to one another instantly .
The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were <UNK> to <UNK> the enemy .
The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief <UNK> was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .
This time , they had been lucky .
The Command post was underground , and well <UNK> .
But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps .
There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as <UNK> , when a direct hit comes along .
This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' .
The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .
There was a <UNK> , cracking sound as the concrete started to <UNK> , the air filled with dust and flying <UNK> , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the <UNK> as <UNK> , as ordered .
That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .
They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , <UNK> blast .
Keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .
The bomb was a solitary one .
The blast <UNK> , but did not destroy the room .
<UNK> eyes met <UNK> as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .
And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the <UNK> and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the <UNK> to Penny and took her hand in his .
The <UNK> married them , on the next day .
After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .
She came from Ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to <UNK> farmers .
But to <UNK> <UNK> mind , such acreage sounded rather <UNK> .
It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .
Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .
He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the <UNK> .
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .
He couldn't stop killing .
That was his true love , not Penny .
The terrible power of a gun , the thing that <UNK> the soul out of a living body , man or <UNK> , was one he never wanted to lose .
And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .
When they got to <UNK> , in <UNK> , he was happy .
This is a <UNK> for <UNK> .
This was the land of the <UNK> , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .
The great black <UNK> .
The <UNK> <UNK> , the jungle <UNK> that is even more noble than the Scottish <UNK> .
He even <UNK> <UNK> , although the Asian <UNK> is not quite as <UNK> as his African cousin .
But there are big <UNK> in both countries .
These were the ones Keith sought out -- the <UNK> , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .
He and Penny would go out on <UNK> elephants , raised from <UNK> in the <UNK> .
And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a <UNK> , Penny <UNK> at the Eden they were <UNK> .
They came upon <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> pools .
<UNK> <UNK> across their path , <UNK> .
There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and <UNK> birds without song .
<UNK> <UNK> played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs <UNK> too close .
<UNK> <UNK> watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted <UNK> when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .
Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The <UNK> and the boat was riding directly over the underwater <UNK> where the green water turned to deepest blue and the <UNK> dropped straight down <UNK> <UNK> , with the <UNK> line beside it ; ;
and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .
He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , <UNK> up to the <UNK> ladder together .
The German <UNK> indicated that Robinson should mount first .
Robinson <UNK> heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his <UNK> assembly .
He was frowning .
He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .
`` <UNK> , temper '' , Mrs. <UNK> said , laughing <UNK> .
A phony blonde hanging onto a <UNK> youth and beauty , but <UNK> <UNK> in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and <UNK> , though it was not yet ten A.M.
`` I <UNK> it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .
`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .
So instead I come up '' .
`` Was it my equipment '' ? ?
The German asked .
`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?
`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up .
He was a huge young man of twenty-four , <UNK> in muscle , immensely strong , with a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of manner that was <UNK> under his present <UNK> .
He stared <UNK> at the floor .
`` I was down to <UNK> .
I've been that far half a dozen times .
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .
`` Well , I get it '' , <UNK> said , still on the ladder .
`` You are a big <UNK> <UNK> and you got this idea about setting a record .
And you also got this little spark in your <UNK> that tells you to turn around before you <UNK> yourself .
So you turn around '' .
`` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said .
A note of <UNK> came into his voice .
`` When I came up , <UNK> , I thought I was going down .
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .
`` <UNK> '' , <UNK> said , and climbed in .
`` That's right '' , Robinson said .
`` I was expecting it , sure .
But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .
You don't head back down again .
Not me , anyway .
Not right away '' .
He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was <UNK> by what had just happened to him .
Waddell , the <UNK> , was a fellow in his middle <UNK> , with a <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> glasses , and a large jaw <UNK> with fat .
Now he was going to show how much he knew .
`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir .
He ran into the <UNK> of the depths .
<UNK> <UNK> .
It makes the <UNK> feel drunk '' .
`` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. <UNK> said , and gave her <UNK> laugh .
`` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , <UNK> said .
`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on .
`` It's nothing to fool with .
It can kill you .
<UNK> , I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' .
`` <UNK> giving anything up '' , Robinson said .
He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ;
and yet like a child among adults .
`` You think I got you and <UNK> and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ?
I'm going down again '' .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
Mr. <UNK> exclaimed .
`` <UNK> not going to give up as easy as all that '' .
He was a <UNK> , <UNK> man in his early sixties , very <UNK> in his <UNK> cap , <UNK> jacket and white <UNK> .
He went to <UNK> West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` <UNK> '' was never used without irony .
Old <UNK> <UNK> , who had once lost a <UNK> bet on whether he could get both <UNK> started and turn on the running lights without <UNK> turning on something else first .
Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had <UNK> from the streets , the object of his pride .
`` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it .
I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop .
Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob '' ? ?
`` Seven years ago , <UNK> '' , Rob said <UNK> .
He was thinking , big deal : <UNK> on his <UNK> fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .
`` <UNK> me '' , he said abruptly .
He went down the steps to the <UNK> and sleeping quarters ; ;
went into the forward <UNK> and locked the door behind him .
`` When you <UNK> go , you <UNK> go '' , Mrs. <UNK> said .
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .
He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the <UNK> .
`` <UNK> there , Schaffner '' , he had said .
`` Can I make you one '' ? ?
`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his <UNK> English .
`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .
Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .
He was in his early <UNK> , rather short and very <UNK> built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to <UNK> himself to American ways .
His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .
Waddell had heard that he had been a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .
<UNK> he had said , making conversation :
`` Rob tells me he's using your <UNK> equipment on the dive '' .
`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said .
`` He's one hell of a decent boy .
I like that kid '' .
`` I agree , yes '' .
`` And if the dive goes <UNK> he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?
`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .
Waddell turned to face him .
`` No '' ? ?
He asked .
`` But that's what he told me .
Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' .
<UNK> looked at him , altogether without <UNK> , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
Waddell asked , frowning .
`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still <UNK> of <UNK> .
`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .
Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .
I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to <UNK> my products .
With all respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these <UNK> '' .
Waddell was not an <UNK> moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .
`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said .
`` But surely you have <UNK> Mr. Roy .
Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .
We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;
of course , I was willing .
But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' .
`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said .
There was the end of his <UNK> feature story , with <UNK> .
He started out the door .
`` One moment '' ! !
Herr Schaffner said .
`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?
`` What else '' ? ?
Waddell asked .
`` If you will <UNK> , I think it would be better if not .
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .
Whatever you tell him he will dive .
I know this from my talks with him '' .
`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , <UNK> '' ? ?
Waddell said .
`` On the basis of the facts '' .
`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .
`` At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .
It is not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm '' .
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .
`` I am an honest man '' , the German said with <UNK> .
`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .
I will make him <UNK> for all of Florida -- a big market .
All tourists come to Florida .
This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .
Yes ! !
But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .
The <UNK> words worked on the <UNK> like a <UNK> from an <UNK> duty .
He took a big <UNK> of his drink .
It would be a <UNK> shame to throw away a story like this .
`` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said .
`` He has the <UNK> for Florida , you say '' ? ?
`` Yes '' , the German said .
`` At least for South Florida '' .
`` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .
I guess you're right '' .
He <UNK> his drink around and <UNK> it in a few large <UNK> .
The story was <UNK> up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , <UNK> <UNK> the unknown ; ;
the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in modern <UNK> America .
`` <UNK> me in another '' ? ?
He had asked .
`` Thank you '' , the German had said <UNK> .
`` I do not drink so much '' .
Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .
<UNK> and relief <UNK> in his <UNK> emotions .
He pressed his <UNK> together and addressed himself to the <UNK> saint of <UNK> in a hurried and anxious whisper .
`` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was <UNK> .
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;
crossed himself ; ;
said a <UNK> Mary , slowly and with understanding .
<UNK> between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .
`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay <UNK> with me on this next dive .
Make it come off all right .
Let me set the record this time , and let me get back <UNK> , so the German will give me the exclusive .
And make my life different and better from this time on .
Amen '' .
He crossed himself again and rose .
He felt a good deal less <UNK> .
As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found <UNK> , who came in and sat down on a bunk .
<UNK> had picked up a <UNK> and was <UNK> it on his <UNK> .
He waited <UNK> before he said , `` Roy , you know your <UNK> table , don't you '' ? ?
`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered <UNK> .
`` You came straight up from <UNK> without a stop '' , <UNK> said .
`` Well , I was a little bit confused .
Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter .
You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?
`` You know what they say about two deep <UNK> in one day '' , <UNK> went on , still <UNK> the <UNK> and studying it <UNK> .
`` I don't think you should go down again '' .
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a <UNK> shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were <UNK> .
As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .
In the <UNK> part of the tree , <UNK> a broad horizontal <UNK> , he could see over the meadow .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .
He had no doubt the marine was the lead <UNK> of a column , and while his shot had probably <UNK> <UNK> , they would soon come hunting .
His <UNK> had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .
<UNK> ; ;
today ; ;
tomorrow : no surrender .
His remembering the <UNK> brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .
He murmured to himself , with <UNK> : `` No surrender '' .
It was best to die fighting the marines .
His <UNK> had also <UNK> this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .
What if the marines never came ? ?
His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .
Then it would be a choice between <UNK> and suicide .
<UNK> the way , he would rot in this vast <UNK> green , his wife never to receive an <UNK> of his <UNK> .
He sighed and leaned for a moment against the <UNK> .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .
The knife , an ammunition <UNK> , and a <UNK> bottle of purified water hung on his belt .
Besides the belt he wore a <UNK> cloth .
As he looked up from picking at a leg <UNK> , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .
<UNK> <UNK> .
The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though <UNK> whether to brave the sunlight .
His <UNK> made a streak of almost <UNK> green in the mist .
`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .
A signal ? ?
Matsuo lifted his rifle , <UNK> the <UNK> under his left upper arm for <UNK> .
<UNK> on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .
They had fought from <UNK> , and the marines <UNK> to burning them out .
Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> great orange <UNK> .
A wave of flame <UNK> through their cave had reached <UNK> , his friend , and with a <UNK> the man <UNK> through the entrance , then slowed to the <UNK> walk of a <UNK> , his uniform <UNK> .
The marines let him advance .
When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to <UNK> without <UNK> the stroke of mercy .
Matsuo had <UNK> death and was <UNK> on a <UNK> of <UNK> , both the burned and the <UNK> , the latter <UNK> rapidly under the tropical sun .
The <UNK> marines had laughed at each other's <UNK> , while <UNK> bodies .
Matsuo repeatedly <UNK> down his own <UNK> .
At <UNK> he had been able to <UNK> down a hillside and into the jungle , <UNK> of death .
<UNK> he peered to the left , to the right into the <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> .
He decided that the marines must be <UNK> around the meadow , with the one left to <UNK> him .
He strained his hearing .
<UNK> feet stepping on <UNK> ; ;
faint <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> ; ;
<UNK> : he heard none of these .
Only the <UNK> of insects and the distant <UNK> call of a bird .
Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .
A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;
leaning <UNK> on a tree <UNK> , he <UNK> it .
<UNK> made Matsuo tremble .
While his comrades <UNK> the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull <UNK> .
Taking aim at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .
He wanted the <UNK> marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .
The shot <UNK> in diminishing <UNK> of sound .
<UNK> followed .
Like a <UNK> boy expecting punishment , Matsuo <UNK> reaction from the jungle .
How stupid to give his position away .
The jungle did not <UNK> .
The sitter remained seated <UNK> the tree .
Before long the atmosphere <UNK> to its old <UNK> , and insects <UNK> and birds occasionally called .
Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete <UNK> , <UNK> that he was the butt of a <UNK> joke .
Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .
He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind <UNK> of the tail .
It ended when he tumbled ; ;
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .
He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .
With a sudden <UNK> he <UNK> in <UNK> direction , crossing the meadow in a <UNK> <UNK> .
When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .
The pockets of his jacket <UNK> .
Hand <UNK> .
The <UNK> head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper <UNK> .
The marine spun , <UNK> a hand high on his chest , and <UNK> forward .
In the <UNK> that followed the <UNK> , Matsuo was tense .
They could come on him now without difficulty .
<UNK> he reached a conclusion .
The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have <UNK> to knock him from the tree .
<UNK> the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .
The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm <UNK> out .
<UNK> ? ?
<UNK> leveled on the man , he made a rush .
<UNK> , in the sunlight , pressed in like an <UNK> crowd .
He <UNK> by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .
With a <UNK> motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .
He was bearded .
The bullet had <UNK> in the area of the right <UNK> ; ;
around the hole , blood <UNK> in a little patch .
<UNK> his <UNK> on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while <UNK> in the jacket pockets .
In one : a package of cigarettes and a <UNK> lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding .
In the other : a <UNK> with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .
One by one he tossed the objects aside .
He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a <UNK> lighter ; ;
he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .
Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
Too bad the marine had no water .
From its holder he took his own <UNK> .
The cap was stuck and made a thin <UNK> <UNK> as he applied pressure .
The <UNK> eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened <UNK> in the <UNK> .
So , alive .
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
The marine reached up a hand .
Matsuo shook his head .
`` None for you '' .
The marine <UNK> , soon dropping his hand .
Not only had he no <UNK> , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .
`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Some odor made him lean over the man .
He <UNK> and recognized it .
<UNK> .
So that had been his difficulty .
<UNK> on sake , he must have <UNK> off from his <UNK> .
The marine tried to roll on his right side , and <UNK> .
When he rolled on the left side , <UNK> on his left <UNK> , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .
`` Be a good <UNK> '' .
<UNK> with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .
The smell of sake had <UNK> <UNK> events in his thoughts .
In the <UNK> , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .
The marine shut his eyes .
`` Are you a <UNK> of flame , marine '' ? ?
Matsuo took the small knife from its <UNK> and laid it on the ground , out of the <UNK> reach and away from their shadows .
He waited in his <UNK> , <UNK> the hair .
Every so often he turned the knife .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .
The sun was noon high and Matsuo <UNK> until his body was <UNK> .
<UNK> also were the <UNK> <UNK> and the face had an oily film .
The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .
Now and again he murmured something that ended in a <UNK> .
He must have <UNK> himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his <UNK> <UNK> .
Matsuo shook his head .
<UNK> .
At last he reached for the knife .
Even the bone handle <UNK> , and he retrieved the <UNK> handkerchief to <UNK> it .
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which <UNK> the eyes .
The marine yelled and flung the hand away .
With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .
A <UNK> <UNK> , kicked legs , and <UNK> hands that circled <UNK> wrist .
Matsuo <UNK> free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;
burned the other cheek ; ;
burned each hand when they came <UNK> again .
The marine <UNK> to weep and it <UNK> the sense of enjoyment .
Matsuo stood up .
`` A small measure of payment , marine '' .
He dropped the knife in its <UNK> , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .
The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his <UNK> side onto his stomach .
He ceased <UNK> .
Matsuo walked toward his tree , once <UNK> back .
The marine was still .
He would soon die .
As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the <UNK> , a mood of gloom <UNK> him like a jungle shadow .
What now ? ?
In the jungle , birds were <UNK> , while insects preserved only the <UNK> of living .
Someone called .
It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called .
Then he <UNK> Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .
He <UNK> his mouth and yelled .
Matsuo <UNK> the rifle off his shoulder .
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die .
He aimed , but listened .
It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese <UNK> there , Japanese '' .
The man tilted back his head and went through the <UNK> of drinking from a container .
He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .
`` <UNK> '' ? ?
Matsuo called .
The marine nodded vigorously .
Matsuo laughed , <UNK> the rifle .
The marine was a <UNK> .
His <UNK> had said that all marines were <UNK> .
The marine <UNK> forward into a bow like a priest before an <UNK> .
<UNK> his own <UNK> , Matsuo took out his water bottle .
One swallow was all he would have ; ;
he was very <UNK> , but he must observe water discipline .
His years of <UNK> had taught him the value of water discipline .
He began to <UNK> the bottle , the <UNK> cap <UNK> on its <UNK> .
<UNK> upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .
Of course it was water he really <UNK> ; ;
down in the <UNK> of the sun he was becoming dried out .
The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .
Matsuo shook his head .
He had no water for an enemy .
And when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter <UNK> to <UNK> other water if he were to discover some <UNK> jungle pool .
He <UNK> the bottle and replaced it .
After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .
Before much longer the marine <UNK> down .
His head <UNK> .
The upper part of his <UNK> had stained dark .
`` Marine .
There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said .
`` Your <UNK> will certainly beat you for your <UNK> , besides the <UNK> of it .
I've nothing for you '' .
From the <UNK> <UNK> of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the <UNK> .
He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .
In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , <UNK> , <UNK> , with the village burning about him and shells <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> back and customers hastily <UNK> their tables as the tall young buffalo <UNK> pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
Blue Throat was <UNK> with his back against the bar , <UNK> supporting his massive frame .
He <UNK> at the stranger as the distance between them closed .
`` Since when did they allow <UNK> kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?
He asked .
`` <UNK> to me I don't remember <UNK> any law about that '' .
He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo <UNK> came closer .
`` <UNK> right here where you are , kid '' , he called .
`` I don't aim to have <UNK> breathing down my neck when I'm <UNK> '' :
The stranger ignored him .
He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang <UNK> right hand was on the butt of his revolver .
`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat <UNK> body '' .
`` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?
`` Because I'm asking .
Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
Blue Throat winked at his six <UNK> .
`` The kid has no manners , boys .
Shall we teach him some '' ? ?
His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .
<UNK> <UNK> fist swept over in a <UNK> right cross and <UNK> the big <UNK> on the side of his chin .
His head snapped round and he <UNK> back , <UNK> into the table where his <UNK> were <UNK> .
Tilghman <UNK> on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him <UNK> against the bar .
A bullet <UNK> into the bar top an inch from <UNK> stomach as Blue <UNK> <UNK> started shooting .
Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .
The <UNK> roared twice and two men dropped , <UNK> .
A third shot <UNK> the light .
Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? ?
`` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old <UNK> body yet .
And I aim to have it '' .
He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .
Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .
`` <UNK> , Tilghman , I'm <UNK> '' .
`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat <UNK> .
Somebody brought a light .
Tilghman and his partner , George <UNK> , <UNK> the men into a corner .
`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said .
I've come for Pat <UNK> body '' .
In two minutes the body of <UNK> former <UNK> , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling <UNK> the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .
Blue Throat , nursing an <UNK> jaw and a <UNK> dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the <UNK> of the fight .
`` That <UNK> will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George <UNK> , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .
Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .
The prediction was correct .
The Reverend James <UNK> had scarcely completed Pat <UNK> last <UNK> on <UNK> Hill in the <UNK> of <UNK> , when shots were heard in the distance .
`` Amen '' , said the Reverend <UNK> , <UNK> his rifle <UNK> up against a <UNK> , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' .
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .
Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his <UNK> for the last six months , certainly had no intention of <UNK> his profitable dictatorship .
It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , and this was the <UNK> <UNK> West method of doing it .
He rode in at the head of sixty <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and took over a <UNK> barn at the entrance to Main Street .
The entire length of the street could be <UNK> with rifle fire from this barn .
Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue <UNK> surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .
The <UNK> citizens of <UNK> had gathered inside <UNK> <UNK> , halfway down the street .
Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .
He <UNK> up the situation and shook his head .
`` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all <UNK> up in here for days '' , he said .
`` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' .
He called the store owner and together they went into the <UNK> .
Billy returned with six sticks of <UNK> .
`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue <UNK> lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to <UNK> 'em through the window '' .
He slipped outside , <UNK> the walls of buildings and <UNK> into <UNK> .
Blue <UNK> men spotted him and a <UNK> of bullets <UNK> the store <UNK> and board walk as he passed .
<UNK> yards away from the barn he <UNK> inside a <UNK> shop and came out at the back .
Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .
All he had to do was light the <UNK> of the <UNK> sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and <UNK> the sticks through .
Billy Tilghman did just that .
Within seconds the big barn was <UNK> into smoking <UNK> , with every <UNK> either dead or injured inside .
It was the abrupt end of Blue <UNK> dictatorship in <UNK> .
Though only slightly injured himself the big <UNK> never returned to those parts .
To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of <UNK> , <UNK> adventures on the side of the law which started in <UNK> when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .
Of all the <UNK> <UNK> tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders .
He was the <UNK> who survived more <UNK> than any other famous <UNK> character in the book .
He saw the most action , beat up more <UNK> with his bare fists , broke up the most <UNK> and sent more <UNK> to the <UNK> than any other U.S. <UNK> who lived before or after him .
For fifty years his guns and <UNK> fists shot holes through and battered the <UNK> out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .
The <UNK> of countless western <UNK> and <UNK> have been <UNK> almost to the point of <UNK> , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his <UNK> career , his achievements and the appalling <UNK> he took while <UNK> the West have remained almost <UNK> .
<UNK> took the view that a <UNK> was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man <UNK> it regularly over a period of half a century .
He came within an ace of being <UNK> with bullets during his long fight with the <UNK> gang which <UNK> Oklahoma in the <UNK> .
<UNK> by Bill <UNK> , these <UNK> specialized in train <UNK> but as a <UNK> they <UNK> stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .
Bill <UNK> ambition , it appeared , was to <UNK> out his name with bullets alongside those of <UNK> James and Billy the <UNK> , and Bill Tilghman had <UNK> he would stop him .
Tilghman knew that some <UNK> were <UNK> with the <UNK> gang .
They bought <UNK> cattle from the <UNK> , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , <UNK> his men in their houses .
Billy decided to set an example by <UNK> one of the <UNK> , named Ed <UNK> , who lived at Rock Fort .
On a bitterly cold day in January , <UNK> , accompanied only by <UNK> Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the <UNK> of <UNK> and headed for Rock Fort and <UNK> ranch .
It was <UNK> hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
The only evidence of occupation came from the <UNK> , which was <UNK> out thick smoke .
The two <UNK> halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
`` Wait here , <UNK> '' , said Tilghman .
`` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .
Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and <UNK> on it .
There was no reply so he <UNK> it open with his foot and stepped inside .
<UNK> opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .
<UNK> near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed <UNK> .
`` <UNK> , Ed '' , said Tilghman .
The rancher grunted an <UNK> but didn't move .
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .
Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a <UNK> <UNK> and caused the hairs to <UNK> on the back of his neck .
Along each side of the room were six <UNK> bunks , each one <UNK> off with a curtain .
And <UNK> <UNK> through these <UNK> were the <UNK> <UNK> of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .
The fighting <UNK> had walked right into a trap and at any moment six <UNK> might <UNK> into his hide .
<UNK> fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .
He walked right up to the fire as though <UNK> unaware of the guns covering him .
The men behind them were Bill <UNK> and five of his gang -- every man a killer .
`` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his <UNK> to the fire .
`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed <UNK> lives .
Can't seem to locate <UNK> in this snow '' .
The rancher was trembling .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .
`` <UNK> the river for five miles '' , he said <UNK> .
`` <UNK> <UNK> is on the south bank '' .
<UNK> the overwhelming temptation to <UNK> himself out of that <UNK> <UNK> , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .
All that time rifle <UNK> were pointing <UNK> at his head and body .
One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .
`` Well '' , he announced , `` <UNK> I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the <UNK> '' .
He <UNK> back to the door , <UNK> softly , hands still <UNK> behind him .
He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .
But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .
<UNK> he climbed on to the wagon next to <UNK> Brown .
`` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly .
`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry .
That place is <UNK> with Bill <UNK> and his gang '' .
Even as he spoke those words Billy <UNK> life hung on a thread .
Back in the house a <UNK> named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave <UNK> , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .
`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill <UNK> , covering Red with his rifle .
`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .
We'll let him go '' .
But the fighting <UNK> <UNK> run of <UNK> from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .
That night he <UNK> out of Ma <UNK> dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .
For several months now , Jack <UNK> , a big <UNK> boy of fifteen with a <UNK> , <UNK> face and <UNK> <UNK> eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a <UNK> .
This <UNK> had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she <UNK> warmth , a sweet warmth ; ;
she would talk to him in a <UNK> voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him <UNK> .
When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .
Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this <UNK> was almost always with him .
He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .
But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .
And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the <UNK> <UNK> school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the <UNK> of Jack's mind assumed the <UNK> face and figure .
He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ;
when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous <UNK> used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .
When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .
Miss Langford ( her first name was <UNK> ) was an attractive girl .
<UNK> , blonde , <UNK> , fair , <UNK> without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of <UNK> <UNK> as she <UNK> among the pupils in her fresh , <UNK> summer dress .
Something was beginning to <UNK> and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ;
but if it had been , it had been <UNK> until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .
She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the <UNK> and become <UNK> and a little sick .
School began in August , the <UNK> part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very <UNK> with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .
The first two or three days they went home early .
All , that is , except Jack .
He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened <UNK> and put the room in order .
Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she <UNK> down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare <UNK> of <UNK> white leg .
He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .
About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him .
He jumped back , <UNK> and ran , <UNK> , down the hill away from the school .
He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ;
then he slowed to a walk .
The vision became even stronger now .
`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .
`` I've got to get her '' .
That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the <UNK> , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was <UNK> .
He ate <UNK> that morning , and his mother became concerned , <UNK> as he usually ate heartily .
`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?
She said , with the <UNK> of a <UNK> woman for her only child .
`` <UNK> you hungry '' ? ?
`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the <UNK> and eggs .
Outside it was already hot at <UNK> A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .
He felt a little sick at his stomach .
`` Are you sick '' ? ?
`` No '' , he said .
`` I'll be all right .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .
`` Don't you play hard today then .
And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .
<UNK> left the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon '' .
`` <UNK> , I won't play hard '' , he promised .
Just then Charles <UNK> yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the <UNK> road which ran behind the <UNK> house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and <UNK> out the kitchen door , <UNK> `` <UNK> , <UNK> '' over his shoulder .
`` <UNK> say , boy '' ? ?
Charles said , <UNK> , showing his huge yellow teeth .
Charles , also fifteen , was tall and <UNK> , <UNK> , with straight black hair like an <UNK> and sharp brown eyes .
He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .
`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?
Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the <UNK> <UNK> , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .
Jack knew of course that the tale to be <UNK> would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were <UNK> only apparent interest .
But Jack always derived <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> ( even when he suspected his friend of <UNK> or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .
`` No .
What '' ? ?
`` I got Margaret <UNK> in one of them old box cars down there by the <UNK> '' .
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .
His heart beat faster .
`` Hell you say '' ? ?
He said , <UNK> into the <UNK> he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .
`` <UNK> you do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I <UNK> got on top of -- ''
`` No , I mean <UNK> you get her to do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I <UNK> ask her '' .
`` <UNK> like that '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes .
She's been <UNK> around me a lot here lately , and I <UNK> I might as <UNK> try it .
Besides I heard her old uncle that <UNK> there has been <UNK> it '' .
`` I never heard that '' .
`` It's all over <UNK> .
If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your <UNK> '' .
`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said <UNK> , thinking of Miss Langford .
When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse .
Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and <UNK> white <UNK> , without <UNK> , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .
`` Time for books '' , she yelled , <UNK> a little <UNK> store bell in her right hand .
`` Let's go inside '' .
`` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just <UNK> '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling <UNK> .
`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .
`` Maybe at dinner time .
Come inside now '' .
The children <UNK> stopped playing then and <UNK> into the schoolhouse .
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .
He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret <UNK> .
Occasionally he would look across the <UNK> at Margaret , fourteen and <UNK> in a fresh green <UNK> dress , sitting in the <UNK> row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .
At <UNK> , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .
`` Why ain't you <UNK> ball '' ? ?
He asked Charles <UNK> as they sat in the <UNK> shade , watching the girls <UNK> in front of the schoolhouse .
`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .
`` I'd <UNK> stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .
`` Maybe '' , Jack said <UNK> , watching for Miss Langford .
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , <UNK> , `` <UNK> , <UNK> '' .
`` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and <UNK> off his overall pants .
`` <UNK> '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .
They played crack the whip a few minutes without <UNK> .
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled <UNK> , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .
While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` <UNK> , I'm sorry , Miss Langford .
I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .
`` That's all right '' , she said , <UNK> her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .
`` It was my fault '' .
With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other .
When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .
`` Thank you '' , she said , <UNK> herself off .
`` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? ?
One of the little girls said .
`` No more today .
Maybe some other day '' .
`` Oh , <UNK> '' , the girl said .
`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .
`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .
Jack walked off alone out the road in the <UNK> <UNK> sun , past Robert <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .
When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .
He simply would not work his <UNK> problems when the teacher held his class .
That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .
He had considered throwing <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand <UNK> in a corner instead of stay in after school .
The only <UNK> now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .
`` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately .
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .
`` All right , if you can't do your <UNK> during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .
`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .
And so when the others <UNK> out that afternoon Jack remained <UNK> in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a <UNK> manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they <UNK> , going home .
He scarcely saw them .
His heart was <UNK> like a mighty <UNK> and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it ? ?
On the fringe of the amused <UNK> of white <UNK> stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and <UNK> .
She <UNK> little <UNK> <UNK> called <UNK> belly and kept her green , somewhat <UNK> eyes fixed on a <UNK> male who was <UNK> wildly with a <UNK> king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .
<UNK> and muscular , he had <UNK> features , and his light color told of the European <UNK> who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .
The <UNK> white girl turned to a distinguished , <UNK> man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , <UNK> <UNK> .
It is almost time for and <UNK> to begin '' .
<UNK> Henri <UNK> was one of New <UNK> most important and <UNK> slave owners .
He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .
The slaves ran <UNK> to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a <UNK> youth they called Johnny <UNK> .
Johnny vigorously <UNK> two <UNK> steer bones against the <UNK> which served as his drum .
He showed his <UNK> <UNK> of teeth and <UNK> <UNK> , his brass <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as he shook and <UNK> in <UNK> .
The <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> with frantic intensity as the dancers began the <UNK> , a <UNK> <UNK> which had long been a favorite of <UNK> <UNK> and their <UNK> in the Louisiana slave compounds .
The dance was of <UNK> origin .
The white girl with the penetrating green eyes <UNK> the <UNK> handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had <UNK> skin and <UNK> eyebrows .
He was <UNK> in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and <UNK> the manners of his owners .
He proudly wore the blue <UNK> of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the <UNK> oldest and most cherished names .
Delphine was a <UNK> in high society .
She was a top <UNK> and one of the city's most gracious <UNK> .
Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a <UNK> , a <UNK> and <UNK> mad -- the <UNK> of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .
Madame Lalaurie <UNK> with her riding crop toward the <UNK> youth who was <UNK> and <UNK> with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .
The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy <UNK> by the other slaves .
He was gifted with animal <UNK> and a potent <UNK> for women of any race .
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his <UNK> plantation in <UNK> St. John .
<UNK> , actually , he avoided feminine <UNK> and seemed truly ignorant of the <UNK> desires when they sought to make <UNK> with him in the open fields , in <UNK> and in <UNK> .
This young slave was therefore quite <UNK> when Delphine Lalaurie <UNK> that she wanted him to draw near .
The woman <UNK> the youth with the <UNK> a coin <UNK> might display toward a rare <UNK> which is not yet in his collection .
`` What is your name , boy ? ?
Come a bit closer .
I won't bite , you know '' .
He <UNK> at Madame Lalaurie and <UNK> the Paris perfume which <UNK> from her .
Then he smiled <UNK> .
`` My name is Dandy <UNK> , <UNK> .
I belong to Master Alexander <UNK> '' .
She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms .
You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' .
Mrs. Lalaurie <UNK> <UNK> the slave toward her waiting carriage .
<UNK> her <UNK> , she climbed in , never <UNK> her grip on his arm .
The woman seemed utterly <UNK> of the snake which <UNK> on the floor in a <UNK> .
Once inside the <UNK> <UNK> , she drew the <UNK> and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army <UNK> .
<UNK> at last , and after a few <UNK> <UNK> on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her <UNK> driver .
This was the big man with the <UNK> air and the <UNK> , <UNK> eyebrows .
`` <UNK> ! !
I want you to find Monsieur <UNK> at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .
There's $600 in gold in this <UNK> <UNK> .
If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .
<UNK> has <UNK> and depends on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> .
Besides , he owns 300 slaves .
One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
<UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> who had been brought in chains years before from his native <UNK> <UNK> , smiled <UNK> and touched his <UNK> <UNK> hat .
His bold eyes <UNK> the woman , and a <UNK> spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?
The <UNK> said softly .
`` This one is a tender chicken , <UNK> ? ?
Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .
It will <UNK> and <UNK> easily for Madame '' .
`` Be quiet , <UNK> ! !
You are <UNK> your place '' .
The tall <UNK> walked off <UNK> in search of Alexander <UNK> .
Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her <UNK> hands and drove Dandy <UNK> -- <UNK> in the back seat of the carriage -- to her <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> Street .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the <UNK> at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the <UNK> <UNK> .
Dandy , curiosity <UNK> his <UNK> , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .
He saw a <UNK> man with a <UNK> <UNK> beard and an unusually large head .
Dr. Lalaurie wore a <UNK> smoking jacket , and his <UNK> eyes were <UNK> and <UNK> behind thick <UNK> <UNK> .
He was about 50 years old .
`` Another young man , my dear ? ?
<UNK> , you are most <UNK> to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with <UNK> .
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician <UNK> it like a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual <UNK> , quite <UNK> in many ways .
He deserves a better life than just <UNK> away on the <UNK> plantation '' .
`` Quite so , my dear .
His room will be ready shortly '' .
The physician led the horses to the stable after a <UNK> glance at the <UNK> slave .
Had Dandy been older or <UNK> , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to <UNK> from the <UNK> tender care if he valued his life .
But he liked the smell of <UNK> perfume .
Besides , her <UNK> and <UNK> in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .
Also , he was weary of plantation <UNK> and <UNK> .
So Dandy <UNK> <UNK> entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and <UNK> up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .
<UNK> and <UNK> though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a <UNK> life with six brothers and sisters and <UNK> relatives in a <UNK> at <UNK> St. John .
He bounced <UNK> on the <UNK> bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than <UNK> .
It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the <UNK> that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .
When he finally left the sinister <UNK> on <UNK> Street , he was carried out in a <UNK> basket .
Just six weeks after Dandy <UNK> arrival at the <UNK> , the little surgeon and his <UNK> young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New <UNK> oldest and <UNK> families were invited .
A <UNK> orchestra played softly behind the <UNK> <UNK> , and Delphine <UNK> <UNK> among her guests , <UNK> <UNK> of the forthcoming races , the latest <UNK> from Paris , and Louisiana politics .
Suddenly there was a <UNK> upstairs , a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , and the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and died as the musicians and guests <UNK> at an <UNK> descending the marble staircase .
It was Dandy <UNK> , <UNK> only in a <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> as if the devil were breathing hard on him .
The <UNK> once superb body was a mass of scars and <UNK> .
His <UNK> face showed the <UNK> of <UNK> .
<UNK> he pointed an <UNK> finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` <UNK> woman ! !
You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .
These were the last words he ever <UNK> .
<UNK> , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> shirt and <UNK> the politician wore .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the <UNK> form of the slave on the <UNK> dance floor and pronounced him dead .
The ball broke up in confusion .
<UNK> stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made <UNK> <UNK> .
Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the <UNK> <UNK> .
But at the <UNK> <UNK> Delphine told a <UNK> story .
`` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .
It was our hope to <UNK> him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .
After I paid Monsieur <UNK> for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .
How he returned in such a <UNK> condition , or why , I cannot say .
Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .
She <UNK> at her swimming eyes with a <UNK> handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! !
He must have fallen in with evil <UNK> , for he was a simple youth and quite <UNK> and <UNK> .
<UNK> must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .
Such a <UNK> end '' ! !
Though the <UNK> dying words about the woman troubled the <UNK> panel , <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> an <UNK> by the jury and <UNK> .
The <UNK> were at the top <UNK> of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the <UNK> of so <UNK> a lady .
Moreover , <UNK> slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New <UNK> <UNK> .
So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting <UNK> testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the <UNK> .
Once again life went its <UNK> way -- <UNK> , fox <UNK> , balls and dinners .
The excitement over <UNK> <UNK> death <UNK> and Madame <UNK> stock <UNK> when she resumed her <UNK> chores of visiting the poor and bringing <UNK> and comfort to <UNK> patients in the county hospital .
Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set <UNK> to <UNK> at a <UNK> <UNK> .
Mrs. Victor <UNK> , socially prominent and a neighbor of the <UNK> , <UNK> to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and <UNK> an amazing sight .
The <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> , Delphine Lalaurie , were <UNK> a young girl -- an <UNK> of <UNK> beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie <UNK> .
The girl was not more than 16 .
She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not <UNK> the knife <UNK> on her back .
The bleeding girl was <UNK> fast ; ;
the <UNK> and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down <UNK> Street .
The <UNK> cried out in an <UNK> <UNK> voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will <UNK> out my tongue with her <UNK> ! !
`` <UNK> '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that <UNK> stuff , and the first chair <UNK> me '' ! !
Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him <UNK> from every decent -- and even <UNK> -- group from Greenwich Village to the <UNK> , he had become a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` There ain't <UNK> faster , or <UNK> , or more direct than a <UNK> freight when you <UNK> go <UNK> '' , Feathertop would say .
`` The accommodations may not be the <UNK> , but man ! !
There ain't nobody <UNK> for your ticket <UNK> , neither '' .
He had been <UNK> the <UNK> for a long , long time now .
Ever since the <UNK> , and the trouble with the <UNK> , and <UNK> and the child .
Ever since all that .
It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .
He was -- as he told himself in the <UNK> of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .
Out and out and never to return again .
<UNK> one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been <UNK> .
That was the day it ended .
The freight car was cold , early in the morning .
He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay <UNK> , the <UNK> and <UNK> of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his <UNK> .
He held his <UNK> away from his body , and the little sweet potato <UNK> neatly and <UNK> as he <UNK> its <UNK> .
The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ;
at first <UNK> , caught by grains of corn -- then with a <UNK> into its <UNK> .
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full <UNK> skirt drawing up her <UNK> , and <UNK> music <UNK> away .
`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .
A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .
Hot , that was the word , hot ! !
<UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> wings , with the sun shining down over them .
A poet , yet ! !
His thoughts for the <UNK> neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .
<UNK> ! !
Then the boy <UNK> himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .
He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .
<UNK> hair , high <UNK> , wide <UNK> mouth , a pair of <UNK> <UNK> hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can <UNK> you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished .
`` We made it , Cappy '' , the <UNK> said .
`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , <UNK> her close .
`` <UNK> '' ! !
Feathertop interrupted , standing up , <UNK> the pig <UNK> from his dirty pants .
`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .
They <UNK> and saw him , standing there dim in the <UNK> light from the <UNK> freight wall .
He was big , and <UNK> , and his toes stuck out of the <UNK> tops of his shoes .
He held the black plastic <UNK> lightly .
`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , <UNK> them toward him .
`` That <UNK> is <UNK> over here '' .
The girl smiled , and started forward .
The boy <UNK> her back hard , <UNK> her off her feet , and gathered her into the <UNK> of his arm .
`` Now stay with me , <UNK> '' , he snapped <UNK> .
`` I <UNK> to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .
We don't know this guy '' .
`` <UNK> , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .
This guy was strictly from <UNK> .
But nowhere ! !
`` What is with this <UNK> jazz '' ? ?
Feathertop inquired , <UNK> against the <UNK> <UNK> wall .
`` We -- we <UNK> '' , Cappy said .
His head came up and he said it <UNK> .
`` Well , <UNK> '' .
Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .
These two were going to be easy <UNK> .
They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the <UNK> Feathertop rolled had much .
And besides , the <UNK> had a little something the others didn't have .
That was gonna be fun collecting ! !
But not just yet .
Feathertop was a <UNK> .
He liked to <UNK> his meat before he tasted it .
`` Come sit '' , he repeated , <UNK> to the piled hay bags , over the pig <UNK> .
`` I'm just a poor <UNK> man , name of -- <UNK> -- <UNK> Smith '' .
He grinned at them <UNK> .
`` That ain't your name , <UNK> '' , the boy accused .
`` And you know -- you're right '' ! !
Feathertop aimed a finger at him .
`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl <UNK> .
`` He's <UNK> .
He's a nice guy '' .
She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .
Feathertop watched the smooth <UNK> of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and <UNK> them beneath her , <UNK> the skirt out in a wide circle .
He cleared his throat ; ;
it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within <UNK> distance .
He had it all <UNK> , of course .
<UNK> the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a <UNK> ball with the doll .
<UNK> -- <UNK> ! !
`` <UNK> you come from , Mr. -- <UNK> -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?
<UNK> inquired politely .
`` Where from '' ? ?
He <UNK> .
`` Out .
I been riding train for a ways now '' .
They <UNK> into silence , and the freight <UNK> up a hill , <UNK> down the other side , shaking and <UNK> to itself .
After a while , <UNK> murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into <UNK> , honey '' .
`` What's the matter , she <UNK> go the bathroom '' ? ?
Ernie found it immensely funny .
The boy <UNK> at him , and the girl looked shocked .
`` No ! !
Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! !
She snapped at him .
`` I only said I was hungry .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .
<UNK> <UNK> Feathertop Ernie <UNK> voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .
`` <UNK> <UNK> say so , fellow <UNK> ! !
Why , we got dinner right here .
<UNK> , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' .
Cappy looked <UNK> , but he moved off the <UNK> and followed the dirty <UNK> to the center of the <UNK> <UNK> .
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
He took out a small <UNK> filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and <UNK> folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .
He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .
`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
`` <UNK> it '' , he told Cappy , <UNK> him a sheet of newspaper .
`` Yeah , but <UNK> we gonna eat ? ?
<UNK> '' ? ?
`` <UNK> '' , Ernie <UNK> a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my <UNK> patience '' .
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of <UNK> .
`` Hot dogs , man .
Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly <UNK> '' .
He <UNK> down the <UNK> carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .
Almost immediately they began to <UNK> .
He looked up and grinned .
`` A <UNK> <UNK> '' , he explained .
`` I <UNK> '' .
When they had licked the last of the <UNK> taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .
<UNK> kid , Ernie thought , too bad .
`` How come you're riding the <UNK> , kids like you '' ? ?
Ernie asked .
Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .
But surprisingly , <UNK> face came up and she said , `` My father .
He didn't want us to get married .
So we ran away '' .
`` Why didn't he want you to get <UNK> '' ? ?
This time even she did not answer .
She looked down at her hands , too .
After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy .
It was my fault '' .
<UNK> head came around sharply .
`` Your fault , hell ! !
It was all my fault .
If I'd been careful it never <UNK> '' -- he stopped abruptly .
<UNK> eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm <UNK> '' .
Cappy <UNK> at himself .
`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !
You never heard <UNK> like it : <UNK> gonna go have an <UNK> , and <UNK> gonna go away to a <UNK> , and <UNK> this and <UNK> that like he was nuts or <UNK> , <UNK> '' ? ?
Ernie nodded .
This was a slightly different matter .
He remembered <UNK> , and the child .
But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .
A time before the white lightning and the <UNK> had turned him inside out .
But these kids weren't like him .
Oh <UNK> ! !
He thought , <UNK> out of it , old son .
These are just another couple of characters to roll .
What they got , you get .
Now forget all this other .
`` <UNK> drink '' ? ?
Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet <UNK> from his jacket pocket .
`` Yeah .
Now that you offer '' .
The answer came from the open door of the <UNK> .
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .
Ernie stared at the man .
He was big .
<UNK> big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a <UNK> .
Road gang , Ernie thought .
`` You gonna give me a drink , <UNK> '' ? ?
The big man asked again , taking a step into the <UNK> .
Ernie hesitated a moment .
This character could break him in half .
`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .
He <UNK> down <UNK> of the strong <UNK> and <UNK> the remainder .
The man <UNK> toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden <UNK> .
He took the bottle with undue <UNK> , and making <UNK> <UNK> with his thick lips , <UNK> it completely .
He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and <UNK> <UNK> .
He <UNK> again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .
`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .
`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .
`` We're going to Philadelphia '' , <UNK> said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .
`` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final <UNK> for Ernie .
He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .
`` Maybe you and me will , <UNK> , but these two ain't <UNK> nowhere '' .
He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .
Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! !
The <UNK> <UNK> toward them , and <UNK> <UNK> back , her hand to her mouth .
Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the <UNK> of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .
The kid hit the bigger man with an <UNK> <UNK> ! !
And carried him backward in a <UNK> tackle .
They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but <UNK> arms and legs .
The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was <UNK> back .
The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` <UNK> '' ! !
Then they were <UNK> again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious <UNK> .
He held the knife <UNK> an instant -- an instant enough to press the <UNK> .
The blade came out with a <UNK> ! !
He <UNK> the knife <UNK> , and drew back to <UNK> it into the kid's throat .
<UNK> screamed <UNK> and her face was white .
She grabbed at <UNK> sleeve and <UNK> , `` Help him ! !
Help him ! !
Do something '' ! !
They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .
To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , <UNK> , <UNK> , never breaking the boredom of the streets .
The Old Man was unimportant .
Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees <UNK> against the screen door in early June ; ;
or the smell of thick <UNK> paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and <UNK> -- rising up from aluminum <UNK> wrapped in <UNK> <UNK> .
Or the <UNK> whirling sounds of <UNK> at night , when their black bodies <UNK> into the <UNK> above and below the <UNK> street lights .
Or the bay of female dogs in heat .
They never called him by name , although he had one .
<UNK> <UNK> , that's what he was called in the old country ; ;
but here he was just <UNK> or the Old Man .
But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .
Youth <UNK> when commanded .
It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .
But youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .
The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .
But the past was dead here as the present was dead .
Once the Old Man had had a wife .
And once she , too , ignored him .
With a tiny <UNK> wrapped around her shoulders , she <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> down the street before him and didn't stop .
In one hand she <UNK> a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .
The way she <UNK> down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .
Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange <UNK> , rode away in it , and never came back .
`` But she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said .
`` No , no .
Not that one .
She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> , <UNK> ! !
She gave herself fancy <UNK> ! !
Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' .
They had slapped their <UNK> .
`` It's not for making pretty speeches about <UNK> those <UNK> get paid so good '' .
`` <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> fingers , <UNK> only by the <UNK> of polished <UNK> , had swayed <UNK> beneath <UNK> <UNK> where tiny black hairs <UNK> , never to be <UNK> away .
<UNK> mouths that had never known anything <UNK> than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .
`` <UNK> '' ! !
But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a <UNK> .
It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the <UNK> <UNK> of a woman he had consumed -- watching her become <UNK> and <UNK> in the distance , as thin as the seams on her <UNK> , and still <UNK> .
His voice had not commanded her to stop .
It had not questioned why .
The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ;
but he might have been <UNK> away the <UNK> that <UNK> from his yellow dog onto him .
( He was never without that dog .
) And his eyes -- those miniature <UNK> of <UNK> yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction .
The Old Man's very soul could have left him and <UNK> down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it .
Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .
But when he called for his <UNK> , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? ?
There seemed to be a <UNK> purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .
For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the <UNK> of Philadelphia .
It could have been Bari or <UNK> for the way it smelled .
What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of <UNK> Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the <UNK> station into the city's center at <UNK> intervals ? ?
Or that the tiny <UNK> spun its silent course toward the <UNK> ? ?
This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his <UNK> .
To him they were one and the same .
<UNK> for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of <UNK> trees which divided these quarters from the city .
<UNK> lined the streets with two-story houses the color of <UNK> .
It slashed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden <UNK> .
It swayed with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> of screen doors .
Even the <UNK> , which housed nothing now but the <UNK> of rot , had a lawn before it .
And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose <UNK> beneath its window .
The <UNK> <UNK> of coffee <UNK> thrown against it .
Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .
It <UNK> low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron <UNK> supporting a glass <UNK> .
That was <UNK> shop .
Above it , from a <UNK> <UNK> , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .
Did the Old Man remember them there ? ?
Yet everywhere else <UNK> was <UNK> and wood in square blocks -- like <UNK> <UNK> against the <UNK> of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .
Only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through the walls of those <UNK> into the mysterious core of <UNK> behind the houses where <UNK> owned no fences , where one man's property <UNK> with the next to form <UNK> in which no one knew privacy .
Love and hatred and fear were one here , <UNK> only by <UNK> trees and <UNK> vines .
And the <UNK> tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .
The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .
They kept him alive , waiting .
<UNK> for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .
It was as though he had made a <UNK> with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .
He was holding out for something .
He was determined to hold out .
The Old Man's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the <UNK> of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .
At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ;
neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .
He was named <UNK> as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn't have cared less about that either .
To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .
When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .
He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in <UNK> houses on the other side of the park .
He would not ride the <UNK> local to the city each morning .
He would not carry a brief case .
Nor would he work at all .
He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .
He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a <UNK> fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , <UNK> with her running , calling out in her <UNK> , `` At your service '' .
He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his <UNK> pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his <UNK> -- and light and smoke .
He could do that when he would be a man .
`` Hey , Laura '' ! !
He called to his sister on the porch above the steps .
She was only ten months older than he .
`` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ? ?
Laura did not answer him .
She leaned <UNK> against the broken porch fence , <UNK> and drying her wet , <UNK> hair in the sun .
One <UNK> leg <UNK> the <UNK> and swung loosely before the <UNK> , torn <UNK> .
Her <UNK> foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed <UNK> toward <UNK> toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips <UNK> white .
All the while she sat there , her <UNK> arms <UNK> before her chest .
Her face showed no sign of having heard <UNK> .
It was a face that had lost its <UNK> <UNK> and was beginning to <UNK> within its fragile features a <UNK> that <UNK> the lyric lines of its contours .
The eyes , blue and always somewhat <UNK> , possessed a sullen quality .
Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were <UNK> by distance .
He was never sure they fully took him in .
<UNK> called again , `` Laura '' ! !
But the only answer that reached him was the <UNK> of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .
`` She's in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood '' .
Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ?
And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .
Not even Laura .
Suddenly he was interrupted in his <UNK> by a warm <UNK> <UNK> against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a <UNK> <UNK> tongue , <UNK> against the salt taste of him .
Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> within a sphere of <UNK> pink skin , stared <UNK> at him .
`` Christ sake , <UNK> , <UNK> '' ! !
But the <UNK> would not .
`` You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ?
<UNK> it with his hand , knowing the <UNK> <UNK> and the swollen <UNK> of <UNK> that wrinkled <UNK> to his touch .
<UNK> rolled over .
His head <UNK> gradually , covering space , to come <UNK> beneath the <UNK> belly within the warmth of those <UNK> .
With his mouth opened wide , he <UNK> the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue <UNK> the light , earthy taste of it .
The boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a <UNK> player , pressing and pulling , <UNK> in what he did .
Above him slid the <UNK> shadow of a storm cloud .
Its form was a heavy figure in a <UNK> <UNK> .
But the boy could see only the <UNK> belly .
The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , <UNK> something <UNK> in it .
He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow <UNK> back .
There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man <UNK> himself , to pay the devil his due .
Time enough to give up his soul .
In the meantime , six <UNK> , stained an <UNK> , the same color as <UNK> shaved hair , <UNK> up close to him .
The <UNK> they made on the concrete interrupted him in the <UNK> pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the <UNK> and <UNK> to be <UNK> its <UNK> for <UNK> .
He knew at a glance that the biggest <UNK> belonged to <UNK> , the <UNK> ones to <UNK> , and the <UNK> ones to <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> brother .
<UNK> expected <UNK> small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .
He expected <UNK> thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her <UNK> , <UNK> voice to sound against the <UNK> of his <UNK> flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .
People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .
The room filled with smoke , and <UNK> head <UNK> with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to <UNK> it .
Little Anne rapidly <UNK> her mother in recovery .
In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a <UNK> of <UNK> hair all over her head .
She stopped flying into <UNK> and started <UNK> her food ; ;
she developed a <UNK> and cream <UNK> and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .
She was so heavy that <UNK> arms shook from <UNK> her and taking care of her .
Maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be <UNK> through the <UNK> old <UNK> and <UNK> out and <UNK> back ; ;
there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
<UNK> had a great deal to do with it ; ;
Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .
Mr. <UNK> would have preferred death and <UNK> to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his <UNK> <UNK> , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .
Maggie and Stuart <UNK> over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few <UNK> more .
In <UNK> Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? ?
`` It seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said .
She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .
`` I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said .
`` It would make me feel a lot better , but the <UNK> Exchange isn't taking <UNK> goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the <UNK> too young to be put in a nursery '' .
`` I should think so '' , Eugenia said .
`` For one thing you can stop keeping that child in <UNK> dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day '' .
`` She's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice '' .
Maggie said .
She picked up the baby and <UNK> her fat warm little neck .
`` <UNK> be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be <UNK> '' , Eugenia said .
`` <UNK> Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a <UNK> <UNK> until it was nine months old '' .
`` <UNK> Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about <UNK> Mae Evans '' .
`` Well now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said .
`` I'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' .
`` I'm sorry .
I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' .
`` Well , let's see .
Let's make a list of your assets '' .
Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she <UNK> the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .
When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope <UNK> down words and figures .
`` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said .
`` We could put up <UNK> on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a <UNK> where it's nice and sunny , but of course it would <UNK> quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that '' .
`` What else '' ? ?
`` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
`` Every woman in the block has tried that '' .
`` What about a tea room , then ? ?
You could set up tables in the front room and serve <UNK> and your <UNK> beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a <UNK> and tell <UNK> '' .
`` It's too elaborate .
And Grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I '' .
Eugenia sighed .
She said , `` Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra <UNK> jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' .
`` Oh , I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said .
`` But it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' .
`` Don't worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .
Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and <UNK> about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be <UNK> up on her <UNK> so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it .
`` And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .
And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I'm doing the washing '' .
`` What are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything '' ? ?
Maggie laughed .
She said , `` Oh Eugenia , I wish ''
`` What '' ? ?
`` I wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said .
`` All of them for you '' .
It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the <UNK> of countless numbers of people .
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .
The cold settled like a tangible <UNK> over the <UNK> High City , locking it in an icy grip that <UNK> its <UNK> and altered its physical appearance ; ;
it had a look of grim <UNK> realism , <UNK> other cities whose <UNK> climate was cold , instead of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> Western city <UNK> in eternal <UNK> at the foot of mountains stored with endless <UNK> and resources .
The <UNK> huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .
There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ;
there never had been a need felt for such facilities .
That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created <UNK> with their stock markets and their <UNK> <UNK> and their <UNK> <UNK> of industries , protected by <UNK> freight rates .
The East was <UNK> supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ;
and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .
The government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold <UNK> everything .
<UNK> , people talked and argued ; ;
all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate <UNK> and something had to be done .
Something had to be done ; ;
it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .
Something had to be done .
The <UNK> said it to each other a dozen times a day .
Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half <UNK> , for <UNK> , for clothes , for the new <UNK> in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ;
about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor <UNK> that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .
Just dropping the <UNK> bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .
The <UNK> furnace consumed fuel like a giant <UNK> <UNK> that had to be <UNK> by <UNK> tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .
Cold came in the <UNK> <UNK> that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around <UNK> window frames , from the sleeping <UNK> , the attic , from the <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> on the roof .
Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the <UNK> and an electric heater in <UNK> room .
It was so cold and so <UNK> that a sort of desperate <UNK> <UNK> all of them , like people <UNK> or <UNK> or caught in some other <UNK> of circumstance so that time stood still and minor <UNK> fell away and the only important thing was to <UNK> together and survive .
The <UNK> burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their <UNK> while they <UNK> the <UNK> .
They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ;
they moved <UNK> bed and the <UNK> basket there , and the rest of them <UNK> by the stove and ran <UNK> and shivering to the upper <UNK> regions and plunged into icy beds .
Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .
`` You said a <UNK> '' , Eugenia said grimly .
Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the <UNK> of poverty wearing thin .
She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to <UNK> in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .
`` <UNK> of people are poor all their lives '' .
`` <UNK> of people haven't our brains and talent '' .
`` I know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said .
`` You're working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the <UNK> family is superior to everything , even a depression '' .
`` The only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said .
They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord <UNK> it to be of <UNK> than it would have to be that way .
She didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .
Hope wouldn't hear of it , and she took the heater back to <UNK> room , and Grandma took it back to <UNK> room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma <UNK> it over and almost set her <UNK> on fire .
She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .
Eugenia suspected her of deliberately <UNK> the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .
`` <UNK> of her to use it up .
<UNK> in a case like this , but '' --
`` You can joke ! !
<UNK> you read it ? ?
She's married that <UNK> ! !
''
`` I read it , yes .
This ought to simplify <UNK> life '' .
<UNK> had more to say .
<UNK> had gone to live in California .
He'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that <UNK> had left because <UNK> had <UNK> him for Roy <UNK> .
`` It was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it , <UNK> .
<UNK> stayed to get my pin , but it'll be a cold day in June when I go back '' .
`` We will both go back , <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> turned to go inside .
`` Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , <UNK> .
The <UNK> right '' --
`` <UNK> '' ? ?
She swung around .
`` What pictures '' ? ?
`` In <UNK> room ! !
You told me to bring my camera .
I'm not going back '' --
`` Indeed you are ! !
Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ? ?
<UNK> had no idea of <UNK> that <UNK> little <UNK> ! !
This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her <UNK> with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that simple fact .
Wait for me , <UNK> , I'll be dressed in half a second '' ! !
Frank followed her into the bedroom , <UNK> her dress up the back .
`` <UNK> , Frank ! !
They're not going to laugh at the <UNK> and <UNK> very long ! !
<UNK> going is my fault .
I drove him away .
You know it and I'll tell everybody exactly how it happened '' .
She was so beautiful , so <UNK> , so <UNK> .
He kissed her .
`` Make your confession to God , <UNK> dear , not to the congregation '' .
`` I'll decide that when I get there .
I was so cruel to <UNK> , so unfair .
But I'll be fair now ! !
He is coming back , isn't he , Frank '' ? ?
Yes , oh yes .
What else was there to say ? ?
<UNK> to the <UNK> he found some favorite lines from <UNK> Swift on his lips :
`` Under the window in <UNK> weather
I marry this man and woman together .
Let none but Him who rules the thunder
Put this man and woman <UNK> '' .
<UNK> for his lie ? ?
He questioned God's taking time to <UNK> the message , but he felt better about <UNK> , and he took the sealed envelope from its <UNK> , wondering why he had preserved it .
If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .
In any case he would be <UNK> a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a <UNK> peculiarly his own .
It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .
`` You've told God , Frank '' , he said .
`` Why <UNK> the -- congregation '' ? ?
<UNK> for an old clay pot , <UNK> of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little <UNK> to flame , watching it <UNK> , the red <UNK> wax melting and <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> now his beloved son could rest in peace .
`` ' And let me go , for the night <UNK> me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' '' .
A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , <UNK> , difficult not to <UNK> a gifted man , and perhaps he did .
But there were great <UNK> , even for a small man .
Beyond his window were the <UNK> trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .
There lay Grand <UNK> <UNK> , his own young <UNK> <UNK> , but new life and promise for his sons , <UNK> .
He poured his <UNK> of wine for the toast he'd made so often .
`` To absent loved ones '' .
But this last time he drank not to <UNK> but `` To <UNK> '' ! !
Mr. <UNK> -- <UNK> was the only person she knew of in the <UNK> <UNK> neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too <UNK> .
It didn't bother him for everybody from the <UNK> to the preacher to say , `` <UNK> , Miss <UNK> '' , adding a <UNK> `` Roy '' , but it did her .
He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .
<UNK> call Mr. <UNK> Oscar , and Dr. <UNK> <UNK> , and <UNK> Major Frank .
Mr. <UNK> laughed , said he'd feel a damn fool , <UNK> couldn't do that even to please her .
`` You could try .
And if I ever hear you say ' <UNK> <UNK> ' again I'll scream .
And don't tell me you didn't at church Sunday .
I heard you '' ! !
He really hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. <UNK> .
How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and <UNK> <UNK> as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways .
Another weakness -- far more <UNK> than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of <UNK> .
Her horse , rather .
But Mr. <UNK> now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! !
He called her `` the <UNK> '' much as Mrs. <UNK> spoke of `` the Queen , God bless her '' .
He , with fifteen or twenty horses or <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> out there in the barn , was <UNK> only of `` the <UNK> '' , `` the <UNK> <UNK> '' , the <UNK> <UNK> .
For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about <UNK> , going out with him to watch this <UNK> without price <UNK> <UNK> around in her stall .
And what had happened ? ?
<UNK> invariably tried to bite her .
<UNK> , Mr. <UNK> said , just a <UNK> anyway .
`` <UNK> back , Miss <UNK> , she's <UNK> of your <UNK> '' .
Never , `` <UNK> that , you <UNK> devil '' ! !
Never concern for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .
She <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> was due then too ! !
<UNK> for hours to his <UNK> that the war and `` <UNK> <UNK> '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his <UNK> of greatness for the <UNK> of <UNK> to come , <UNK> could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .
<UNK> symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- <UNK> , the indifference with which the <UNK> and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her <UNK> swollen stomach .
<UNK> birth was no <UNK> to Mr. <UNK> .
<UNK> was a fine <UNK> and could get here quick , he suggested .
<UNK> <UNK> to having Dr. <UNK> , a former <UNK> , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .
The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .
He would be in the barn , or riding for the <UNK> ! !
Night after night he stayed with <UNK> in the dead of winter , rubbing her with <UNK> of expensive <UNK> , <UNK> over her <UNK> <UNK> as the cook did over <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .
Yet when the dear baby came , he had <UNK> over here in a <UNK> , and was as <UNK> and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .
<UNK> wished now that she had had Dr. <UNK> , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into <UNK> .
There was something not nice about <UNK> , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see <UNK> <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> day , Miss <UNK> , <UNK> .
<UNK> 'em up <UNK> -- <UNK> , <UNK> ''
<UNK> for her mother , she said firmly , <UNK> , for herself , and --
`` <UNK> , for Miss <UNK> '' , he suggested .
`` She was mighty good to you past times , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her '' .
Now she must be thinking of a <UNK> , something special .
Just wait till she saw the <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> colt in all Kentucky .
Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .
What about Royal <UNK> ? ?
`` Why don't you name him Jesus Christ ! !
'' She burst into tears .
Roy was deeply <UNK> .
He'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet <UNK> had been .
Of course she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it .
He had a good idea why not .
Those elegant `` At Home '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all <UNK> up , hadn't brought many <UNK> in two whole months .
Doc <UNK> and Miss <UNK> had come .
So had Miss <UNK> <UNK> , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his <UNK> <UNK> last year , saying how much she enjoyed her <UNK> house in town in <UNK> weather , was looking forward to <UNK> <UNK> this summer .
There was an idea .
Miss <UNK> had been right <UNK> ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a <UNK> would have brought her round .
Oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver <UNK> <UNK> for all of the trips .
But when Miss <UNK> went over right away to return the call , Miss <UNK> couldn't have been very <UNK> , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .
More and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to <UNK> and <UNK> -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and <UNK> under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a <UNK> over the babies dressed like <UNK> .
Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .
It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss <UNK> had given him , to be told by Miss <UNK> that her holy <UNK> was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs. <UNK> and the children .
She hoped they were well .
He didn't tell Miss <UNK> , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those <UNK> <UNK> , and she really took a fit .
If he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame .
`` Have a party <UNK> leave 'em out , <UNK> '' , he suggested .
`` A <UNK> party , send an invite to <UNK> but them -- those folks you met at the <UNK> House , the ones I've got to know in this new <UNK> Club affair , the whole <UNK> neighborhood .
We'll have <UNK> -- couple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a crowd any time .
I'll see word gets round '' .
`` Don't you dare ! !
''
Miss <UNK> was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and <UNK> up .
He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try .
<UNK> was surprised when <UNK> <UNK> stopped beside her on the <UNK> one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that <UNK> <UNK> had had a call to preach in some mountain town .
Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to <UNK> in , and he'd give her a lift to <UNK> .
Her <UNK> was only <UNK> and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss <UNK> and the babies were getting on .
`` See for yourself , Miss <UNK> .
It won't take a minute '' .
He swung in through his own wide <UNK> .
`` <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> you ever did see , but Miss <UNK> gets mighty <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> the sight of a friendly face .
Miss <UNK> won't care your <UNK> , will she '' ? ?
`` Why of course not '' , <UNK> said <UNK> .
`` He must have <UNK> me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room .
The <UNK> of <UNK> last will and <UNK> was proof enough of that ; ;
<UNK> would never have left her house to a <UNK> woman .
She found herself <UNK> an old wish , that she had told <UNK> she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best <UNK> pin .
Perhaps <UNK> had guessed already and kept her counsel .
Henrietta thought , It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .
There had been more to know about <UNK> , inevitably , and most of it <UNK> .
<UNK> was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .
Their childhood would have been quite <UNK> without <UNK> <UNK> for drama , especially through the long summers .
In winter , in the city , there had been the <UNK> School , which taught <UNK> with a kind of <UNK> passion for knowledge ; ;
there had been lessons in French from a small Polish <UNK> with a really profound <UNK> for his pupils ; ;
there had been the dancing class -- Miss <UNK> , thin and <UNK> , with her <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> .
There had been supper parties and <UNK> , <UNK> and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously <UNK> , enormously <UNK> , the sun around which the <UNK> planets <UNK> .
Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the <UNK> of Charles .
It was safe to assume that Papa , <UNK> heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in <UNK> hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know .
Mama was vulnerable ; ;
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .
But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in <UNK> bed -- she found herself <UNK> how others might regard her .
Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .
She turned on her side , finding the idea <UNK> .
If <UNK> had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ? ?
<UNK> to imagine <UNK> feeling so about anyone .
No temptation , no sin .
No temptation , no virtue ? ?
A curious thought to end a curious night .
The birds were really awake now in a <UNK> of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching <UNK> and door , table and chair and all of <UNK> flowers in their artificial <UNK> and leaf .
Before anything else , she would go to <UNK> grave with flowers from <UNK> forgotten garden .
Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a <UNK> whose nature avoided <UNK> .
She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .
It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .
After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
The garden below was <UNK> with <UNK> and enchanting in its small <UNK> .
<UNK> out , she could see a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .
On a <UNK> spray thick with <UNK> and <UNK> and swelling pink <UNK> , like a summer <UNK> , a bird balanced and sang , <UNK> brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .
It was so pretty and <UNK> that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out <UNK> to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but <UNK> never permitted bare feet and she was <UNK> not a child but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> certain age .
<UNK> suddenly neat and <UNK> , she dressed quite <UNK> and went downstairs .
<UNK> , <UNK> , was not yet up and about , <UNK> that <UNK> was human .
<UNK> protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday <UNK> and milk in a white <UNK> , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going <UNK> .
Outside , the garden , the <UNK> wilderness , yielded a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> , sweet <UNK> , <UNK> stock and <UNK> <UNK> , which she tied with long <UNK> and took back to show <UNK> , who was now stirring about the kitchen and <UNK> <UNK> .
The <UNK> came <UNK> to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , <UNK> the air with <UNK> <UNK> .
Henrietta held her <UNK> out of reach and said it was for <UNK> .
`` <UNK> in the <UNK> '' , said <UNK> <UNK> .
`` Go change your shoes before you turn around '' .
She sounded so exactly like <UNK> that Henrietta <UNK> her under the clear impression that she could either <UNK> or stay home .
<UNK> danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .
To a <UNK> , there was only one church .
The cemetery <UNK> just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .
For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its <UNK> shops just stirring and its inhabitants <UNK> her with the <UNK> curiosity .
She smiled and <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .
Now , some of the <UNK> were cautious , but all were interested .
An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than <UNK> look as she passed , the <UNK> still plainly rising in his branches .
On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .
He <UNK> his ear and shook his head at her repetition , <UNK> in a <UNK> way that he had heard her the first time .
He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was <UNK> .
`` <UNK> been slow to come '' , he said .
`` It's my <UNK> out time '' .
He <UNK> at her flowers .
`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of <UNK> .
`` They'll be <UNK> me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so <UNK> they plan .
See half of 'em in their <UNK> before I choose my own <UNK> .
It's <UNK> myself out that does it '' .
He regarded her with rising hope .
`` You'd like to hear how I go about it '' .
`` It's nice of you '' , Henrietta said <UNK> .
`` <UNK> welcome '' .
He straightened himself , <UNK> against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .
His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a <UNK> for <UNK> the <UNK> aspects of his text .
`` Every month , <UNK> three days '' , he said happily , `` I take no water into my system , no water <UNK> .
It rests the tissues '' .
Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her <UNK> good sense .
`` <UNK> the tissues '' , he said , `` and <UNK> the system .
My <UNK> did it , and he lived to a great age '' .
He looked up at her sharply .
`` Don't remember , do you '' ? ?
She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old <UNK> , who must have been in his <UNK> when Henrietta ran away .
Next to the <UNK> , <UNK> had owned the island most , and she and <UNK> had often stood in front of him , <UNK> by his terrible years -- a <UNK> man with a thin beard and very <UNK> blue eyes like a <UNK> , more aged than possible .
He had never spoken once to the <UNK> sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a <UNK> captain and powerful like the sea .
It must be that son who sat before her now , <UNK> to half his size and half his senses .
She said gently , `` Of course I remember you '' .
`` Not so <UNK> I remember you '' , he said .
`` <UNK> the young <UNK> woman .
<UNK> away on a black night with a <UNK> <UNK> man .
I know all about you '' .
`` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed .
`` Can't blame a man for <UNK> his wife '' , he said quite <UNK> .
`` Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .
Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .
Any harm in that '' ? ?
`` Probably '' , said Henrietta <UNK> .
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her <UNK> .
`` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws .
Only , this old man's <UNK> was even less to her taste than <UNK> <UNK> open <UNK> .
Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .
She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .
She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a <UNK> , <UNK> figure with a clean <UNK> tied over her limp print dress .
She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .
`` You've not had your breakfast yet , <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is no breakfast '' , he said .
`` <UNK> and <UNK> '' ! !
He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his <UNK> and <UNK> on the stones .
`` He's <UNK> today '' , his <UNK> said <UNK> , and bent to pick it up .
`` He's got this idea about drying out ''
`` It ain't an idea '' ! !
`` If it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? ?
He looked <UNK> to heaven and said , `` <UNK> don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious <UNK> of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she <UNK> him his <UNK> of <UNK> .
His <UNK> sighed .
`` Come on , do .
The children are eating , and Miss <UNK> on her way <UNK> '' .
`` To the <UNK> .
Who ain't '' ? ?
`` Not me .
I've got a day's work to do .
-- You'll be visiting Miss <UNK> , <UNK> '' ? ?
Henrietta nodded .
How much they knew about her ! !
The woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when <UNK> and <UNK> had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own .
`` God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .
Come on now '' .
She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .
He <UNK> at her but let himself be led off inside the house , <UNK> <UNK> to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was <UNK> about by those who still had their <UNK> strength .
There was a <UNK> of voices from <UNK> , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of <UNK> from the old man .
Henrietta looked down at her <UNK> , still lively with its color and <UNK> , and set her feet on their <UNK> way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , <UNK> dancing ahead of her .
At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , <UNK> with fat round bushes like sheep .
They were covered with tiny white <UNK> , their <UNK> roots <UNK> at the <UNK> ground , and wild birds <UNK> in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the <UNK> and cry .
The air was full of sounds too but <UNK> ones , a <UNK> <UNK> as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .
She felt <UNK> , walking , and almost easy until the church <UNK> told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to <UNK> .
Both church and <UNK> were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the <UNK> had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` <UNK> <UNK> '' seemed suddenly impossible .
She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with <UNK> , her fingers tracing the <UNK> carved letters <UNK> with green <UNK> .
The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her <UNK> , if only to shade <UNK> flowers .
A small , <UNK> angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .
She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and <UNK> clouds when she and <UNK> , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and <UNK> <UNK> .
The <UNK> family had come from <UNK> <UNK> , in the <UNK> of the main Japanese island of <UNK> , where there are still traces of the mysterious <UNK> strain .
The <UNK> were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal <UNK> of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .
Apparently they were of <UNK> blood .
They had white <UNK> and blue eyes ; ;
all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .
A <UNK> few of them are left now , to <UNK> mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient <UNK> <UNK> , which have the same haunting <UNK> as the <UNK> of the American Indians .
Most of them have been <UNK> , but sometimes a man in <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> is much more <UNK> than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be <UNK> lovely , her <UNK> warmed and improved by a little of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> from the South .
Tommy <UNK> was one of these fortunate occasions .
She was <UNK> than most Japanese girls , and had the <UNK> <UNK> form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .
Her nose was higher of bridge , her <UNK> so pale as to be quite <UNK> to <UNK> , and the fish and vegetable diet of her <UNK> had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .
Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .
She had black eyes , long and <UNK> tilted , and the way she walked was melody .
She had been in Japan just one week .
It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ;
she was already considering putting in <UNK> requests for duty at San <UNK> , <UNK> , the Great <UNK> , <UNK> -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to <UNK> her commission if the request were not granted .
<UNK> would be better than the land of her <UNK> .
There was nothing wrong with her job .
Tommy had been assigned to the <UNK> ward .
There were no <UNK> serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes <UNK> up with the <UNK> to serve as a marriage <UNK> -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high .
At present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese <UNK> firms were not permitted to operate on the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> too close <UNK> , because the work involved setting off <UNK> <UNK> at all hours .
Tommy was interested in <UNK> , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients .
But she suffered in her <UNK> hours .
Such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the <UNK> Club , having coffee and a <UNK> to sustain her until <UNK> .
She had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck .
This was one of the <UNK> crossroads -- you find them all around the world .
<UNK> from the West Coast <UNK> on <UNK> tours of duty with the Seventh <UNK> , and <UNK> was the Seventh <UNK> principal port for maintenance , <UNK> and shore liberty .
<UNK> or later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ;
if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San <UNK> and Long Beach .
And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there .
She felt , rather than saw , the approach of the <UNK> young man .
He came through from the <UNK> Bar , which was <UNK> , with the ice <UNK> <UNK> in a glass he carried .
When he saw Tommy sitting alone , the <UNK> sound stopped .
He was perhaps a trifle <UNK> , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ;
he wore a brown <UNK> sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant .
Probably off one of the carriers -- an <UNK> .
There was a <UNK> chance , perhaps , that he would be <UNK> , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different .
Japan did something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas .
It was as if foreign duty implied and <UNK> license ; ;
it <UNK> that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? ?
Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different .
`` <UNK> , <UNK> '' ! !
He said , turning on what was meant to be charm .
`` You <UNK> <UNK> ? ?
Maybe you <UNK> date with me '' ? ?
`` I beg your <UNK> '' ! !
Tommy said out of her cold rage .
`` I don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it '' ? ?
The <UNK> young officer fell back on his heels , <UNK> and <UNK> .
At least , he had the decency to <UNK> , she thought .
`` Oh -- I'm sorry ! !
You see , I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' --
`` Oh , yes -- you had ideas '' ! !
Tommy interrupted furiously .
`` All wrong ones '' ! !
Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy <UNK> .
`` Take off , <UNK> '' ! !
`` <UNK> -- sorry '' ! !
He muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool .
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy .
She felt like a fool , too .
It hadn't been this way in college , or in <UNK> training ; ;
it wasn't this way in the hospital at San <UNK> .
Everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl .
Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't American .
There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy <UNK> , <UNK> with a <UNK> hint of the <UNK> in their faces ; ;
there are <UNK> from the <UNK> states who are similarly <UNK> , and -- back in the blessed United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women .
Now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being <UNK> at every turn .
She looked around , <UNK> .
Four little Japanese <UNK> were <UNK> the English language at the counter -- <UNK> <UNK> happened to be one of them .
Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` <UNK> '' ! !
For a <UNK> <UNK> , or `` <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
For one cup of coffee .
Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well <UNK> .
One was with a <UNK> and <UNK> lieutenant commander ; ;
the other was with her American husband and their <UNK> appealing children .
Seeing these did nothing for <UNK> mood .
She told herself <UNK> , and with pride , I am an American ! !
And so she was , and would remain .
But she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be <UNK> young men who would approach her with broken English .
There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese .
Tommy wouldn't know ; ;
after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English .
One thing was becoming increasingly sure .
She had been sent to the wrong place for duty .
There was more to service in the Navy <UNK> Corps than the hours in the ward .
One had to have friends , and a <UNK> life in <UNK> hours .
Now there was <UNK> male singing from the <UNK> Bar .
It was terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male <UNK> was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt <UNK> and <UNK> .
She finished her <UNK> and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ;
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated .
<UNK> while angry had given her a slight <UNK> .
Back in her living quarters at the hospital she took <UNK> of <UNK> , and <UNK> .
Then , after a while , she went to her mirror .
It was all true .
She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men .
And , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach .
There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful .
She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of <UNK> -- which was not very far from <UNK> .
And tomorrow she would take time to shop for the <UNK> her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a <UNK> gown .
Tommy , of course , had never heard of a <UNK> , or Japanese <UNK> , which says , `` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' , and is literally translated as `` <UNK> are better than <UNK> '' .
Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is <UNK> than water .
Doc <UNK> scheduled appearance at <UNK> <UNK> was a very unusual thing , because the discipline <UNK> there is ordinarily for the young and <UNK> , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report .
But the beer hall <UNK> in <UNK> had been unusual , too , and <UNK> <UNK> was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in <UNK> rousing .
Just why anybody should wish to start a <UNK> the executive officer didn't know .
In his opinion , Doc had not grown up .
The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief .
There had never been a good reason for Doc <UNK> to grow up .
He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before him .
The war found him much too early , and its <UNK> -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in <UNK> and elaborate practical <UNK> , and even now Doc had never found any <UNK> , <UNK> influence .
He remained young at heart , with an <UNK> sense of humor .
He <UNK> about the <UNK> <UNK> of new men , took great delight in <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> , and gave no thought for tomorrow .
He was doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him .
The job security enjoyed by Doc <UNK> , and nearly all members of the Armed Forces , is a wonderful thing .
Actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by .
He may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired .
Doc had been under <UNK> to the ship since the <UNK> left <UNK> .
This <UNK> him of liberty in Hong Kong , but he told <UNK> <UNK> that Hong Kong was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day .
At <UNK> he was restricted to the <UNK> of the <UNK> because <UNK> <UNK> , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the <UNK> <UNK> .
This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well .
There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many <UNK> that had been dug into the hills on the Naval <UNK> , and visit an old <UNK> .
A telephone line had been <UNK> up to <UNK> the ship with the <UNK> exchange .
After supper , Doc called <UNK> <UNK> , who was now a lieutenant and had a family .
`` Well , Doc , you old <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> exclaimed , with true affection .
`` Come over and have a drink .
We live down by the <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> a taxi '' .
`` I'll be there , but I'll walk '' , Doc said .
`` I've got to run an <UNK> on the way .
See you in about an hour '' .
He threw a smart <UNK> at the <UNK> , went up the <UNK> , and turned down the wide street in front of the <UNK> <UNK> Club .
How , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? ?
He considered some interesting <UNK> but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .
Then there was exercise , boating and <UNK> , which was not only good for you but also made you more <UNK> : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted .
Perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years .
There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a <UNK> .
Perhaps a packing trip into the <UNK> , let his beard grow -- but that was too <UNK> .
I could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? ?
The telephone rang .
`` You missed it '' , <UNK> voice said , `` You should have gone over to the <UNK> Room with us .
<UNK> .
<UNK> , but <UNK> , and <UNK> Williams and her <UNK> band '' .
`` <UNK> , Buzz '' , Owen said .
`` I went over to the <UNK> and dropped two notes '' .
`` <UNK> '' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a <UNK> dinner over at the <UNK> Room on Friday .
Imagine a <UNK> dinner with <UNK> Williams '' .
He laughed and laughed .
Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to <UNK> for <UNK> dinners .
`` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' .
Buzz was a <UNK> <UNK> who never let his victims rest .
When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a <UNK> <UNK> at the door .
`` Yes '' , Owen called out .
`` Yes '' ? ?
`` I'm Mrs. <UNK> Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please '' .
<UNK> , he thought , a <UNK> <UNK> at last .
Probably saw me in the lobby .
He was disappointed to find a nervous , <UNK> woman with a big hat standing at the door .
She <UNK> at his green <UNK> with the yellow <UNK> .
`` How do you do '' ? ?
She said , <UNK> .
`` Our church is <UNK> a group of very <UNK> women up in Alaska .
We call them <UNK> and they go among the <UNK> making friends and bringing the light .
They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
`` You see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the <UNK> glasses <UNK> <UNK> in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many <UNK> they have to undergo '' .
`` Why is that '' ? ?
She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .
<UNK> , Owen thought , <UNK> and <UNK> .
There was a slight nervous <UNK> in the region of her left eye .
It gave her a <UNK> , <UNK> effect .
`` Have you ever tried to reason with an <UNK> '' ? ?
She asked , <UNK> wildly .
`` They are a very difficult group of people '' .
`` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably <UNK> outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' .
She smiled in a <UNK> fashion .
`` You know , that's very interesting .
People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that .
The more <UNK> I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God '' .
<UNK> , Owen kept his peace .
What would happen next ? ?
That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ?
Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice .
`` How did you get by the desk '' ? ?
He asked curiously .
`` I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're <UNK> around the <UNK> , <UNK> on <UNK> doors and talking down <UNK> '' .
`` Oh , I just come once a week .
Every day I visit a different hotel .
I feel it's my duty .
I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these <UNK> .
Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? ?
They travel in pairs as much as a <UNK> miles a day '' .
`` Do you have any idea how far I travel every day ? ?
I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' .
Owen was aware he was getting <UNK> but he couldn't help himself .
Mrs. <UNK> Parker drew back .
`` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she <UNK> .
`` You're in the secular world '' .
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen .
Not that religion isn't big business ; ;
those <UNK> and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don't get top personnel .
Our key salesmen are in <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
`` God , I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said <UNK> .
`` God doesn't have any <UNK> or <UNK> '' , he said <UNK> before he caught himself .
It sounded silly ; ;
why go on ? ?
More people were passing ; ;
he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation .
`` And whiskey '' , she said , smiling and <UNK> at the <UNK> glasses .
`` Don't forget whiskey ; ;
it's such a big <UNK> '' .
`` You know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me .
I have an appointment '' .
`` I can imagine '' , she said .
`` Probably down at the bar .
But what do you want to do about the <UNK> ? ?
They must be freezing up there now .
Can't you help them '' ? ?
`` <UNK> a card or something .
I'll think it over '' .
`` I have no card '' , she said bitterly .
`` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you .
I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual <UNK> '' .
She looked <UNK> , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race .
She stood <UNK> for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ;
he heard her <UNK> on another door .
It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ;
then he realized he was hungry .
He <UNK> , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast .
On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail .
There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic <UNK> on new lines they always issued .
His lawyer had sent him a statement on his <UNK> <UNK> , and there was a letter from the <UNK> of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's <UNK> .
He ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt <UNK> .
He looked off to the crest of the <UNK> , still <UNK> ; ;
the <UNK> of the <UNK> River made a wide <UNK> .
He felt suddenly <UNK> , <UNK> .
With any luck at all he could easily find a <UNK> .
Although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the Golden <UNK> .
The tables were all spinning , the dice <UNK> , the bar crowded .
Just to test himself , he played <UNK> for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars .
The way was opening up ; ;
when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach .
The Golden <UNK> was dimly lit with <UNK> neon .
There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a <UNK> .
They all had the hard look of <UNK> who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up .
The <UNK> around the wall <UNK> early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more <UNK> than the <UNK> .
The women had a bright shining <UNK> as they leaned out from the wall and <UNK> <UNK> into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful .
All , of course , except the <UNK> party who were bent on <UNK> to death .
`` I wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen <UNK> .
He sat down next to a <UNK> blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes .
She sighed a dirty word and left .
Owen was surprised to see Mrs. <UNK> Parker playing the <UNK> <UNK> that were <UNK> arranged by the entrance .
She sat down and played two <UNK> at once , looking grim , as if <UNK> by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the <UNK> depending on her support .
A <UNK> cowboy sat down next to him in the <UNK> place .
He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the <UNK> .
`` What you need is a steady <UNK> '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play .
`` You can't build on your <UNK> <UNK> '' .
`` What are you playing '' ? ?
Owen asked .
`` I'm just <UNK> '' , the cowboy explained .
`` I keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a <UNK> period to find out what numbers are <UNK> .
But <UNK> not my game .
I'm always trying to find a breaking table in <UNK> .
<UNK> , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> to know you .
Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? ?
`` Well , of course I do .
I'm with the <UNK> , pushing a horse called <UNK> .
He's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on <UNK> .
This <UNK> can rack and <UNK> and he's the <UNK> thing in <UNK> County .
I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero .
I once trained a horse for <UNK> Gibson , but nothing like <UNK> .
He's a <UNK> and he photographs wonderfully '' .
Five came up while Owen was listening to The <UNK> and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars .
This proved <UNK> that The <UNK> was a <UNK> , so he walked on down to <UNK> , an even more <UNK> gambling <UNK> than the Golden <UNK> .
When he looked in the back , Mrs. <UNK> Parker was marking <UNK> cards .
His <UNK> spirit had <UNK> ; ;
he studied the pistol exhibition that <UNK> featured as an added attraction .
He <UNK> a long <UNK> with green eyes , but she was a <UNK> with her money in front of her .
He had no great prejudice against <UNK> ; ;
it just seemed such a dry run .
There was no cash around ; ;
everyone was <UNK> silver dollars .
The management <UNK> withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers <UNK> or checks or premium points .
He read a special announcement whereby <UNK> would feature a special <UNK> at three A.M. <UNK> <UNK> ( The <UNK> ) Brenner and fourteen <UNK> <UNK> .
He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him .
He passed two <UNK> , both wearing <UNK> , and they made him feel a little sad .
Owen found Buzz watching <UNK> .
Buzz had on a <UNK> shirt and was carrying some <UNK> oil and dark glasses .
He was shorter and <UNK> than Owen , who felt good standing next to him .
`` We're all going over to Lake <UNK> and try our luck at <UNK> '' , Buzz explained , still <UNK> .
`` We ran into a guy at the <UNK> Room who <UNK> we can beat the wheel .
He started out as a <UNK> , then became a pit boss until the Club found him <UNK> .
He was <UNK> down checks at <UNK> '' .
`` I'm <UNK> to <UNK> '' , Owen explained .
`` Something about the pollen '' .
`` Well , <UNK> '' , Buzz said .
`` We'll see you around later '' .
Owen went over to the <UNK> table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't <UNK> with any consecutive success .
`` How's your luck , honey '' ? ?
A short <UNK> blonde in a bursting <UNK> addressed him .
She looked <UNK> and prosperous , but he didn't get the impression he was being <UNK> the way he'd been hoping .
`` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' .
`` <UNK> me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice .
I'll make them dance the <UNK> .
We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .
`` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' .
`` If you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you '' .
`` <UNK> like real love '' , Owen said .
`` It sort of brings a <UNK> to my throat '' .
`` My <UNK> <UNK> '' , the blonde said after she ordered a <UNK> .
`` <UNK> after the ballet .
My mother wanted to call me <UNK> , but it sounded too affected '' .
Spencer said nothing .
`` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? ?
Spencer shook his head .
Alexander said , `` <UNK> me properly , Spencer '' .
Spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain '' .
`` Very well '' .
Alexander walked away .
Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor .
Philip Spencer had <UNK> planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to <UNK> him for a <UNK> of proper address .
During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no <UNK> effect upon the men of the <UNK> .
Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to <UNK> <UNK> under <UNK> of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him .
<UNK> <UNK> were flashed at both Alexander and <UNK> .
The two met in the <UNK> cabin .
`` What is the next step , Captain '' ? ?
`` More <UNK> , I fear '' .
In your opinion , who is this E. <UNK> on the ' certain ' list '' ? ?
`` Cromwell , of course .
He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot .
He saw the dangers , not the <UNK> of being identified as a <UNK> .
Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' .
There was a tap at the door and <UNK> entered with the word that <UNK> wished to see the Captain .
`` Have him come in '' .
<UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> , brought the <UNK> news that the <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> had been <UNK> removed from their customary places .
`` And also , sir , two articles which were considered <UNK> now must be regarded in another light entirely .
An African knife and <UNK> are at this moment being <UNK> by McKinley and Green .
McKinley was <UNK> to say that he would like to get the knife into <UNK> possession and that '' --
`` Where did you gather all this information , <UNK> ? ?
Who reported to you the disappearance of <UNK> and <UNK> and who '' --
He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with <UNK> and <UNK> behind him .
A glance revealed that the main <UNK> <UNK> had been carried away .
The <UNK> milling about of what had been a <UNK> , <UNK> crew struck Alexander with horror .
He <UNK> orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads <UNK> toward the <UNK> figure as though for further instruction .
<UNK> <UNK> hastened to <UNK> side .
`` Small violently jerked the <UNK> brace with full intention to carry away the <UNK> .
I saw him myself and it was done after <UNK> with Cromwell .
I swear it , sir '' .
And it was clear that <UNK> was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward <UNK> in the sending up of the new <UNK> <UNK> till Philip Spencer had given the signal to <UNK> .
Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .
Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and <UNK> .
Their strategy was sound enough and , he <UNK> , had been defeated only by Philip <UNK> <UNK> to sanction an idea he had not originated .
When the <UNK> was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in <UNK> sprawled upon the open deck and terror <UNK> the <UNK> .
<UNK> potential followers were openly sullen and <UNK> , missing <UNK> without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their <UNK> at the prisoners being kept in <UNK> , <UNK> with the three by glance and signal .
One of the missing <UNK> came out of its hiding place after <UNK> <UNK> had been <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> Wilson .
<UNK> had reported the man to <UNK> and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , <UNK> the weapon .
Wilson , <UNK> and <UNK> , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , <UNK> and McKinley .
Not a man on the <UNK> , loyal or <UNK> , could be <UNK> by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of <UNK> .
In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> to speak and to listen .
Three days had passed since <UNK> arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .
<UNK> said , `` It requires an <UNK> eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely .
To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .
From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that <UNK> boast of twenty <UNK> followers was a modest estimate '' .
`` Well '' , <UNK> <UNK> , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' --
`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in .
`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .
Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ?
Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be <UNK> but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order .
Mr. <UNK> , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ?
Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? ?
<UNK> said , `` Of course they would .
They are about to do so at any moment as it is .
All that is needed is for one man to feel <UNK> enough to take the lead .
As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed .
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
`` That is <UNK> language , Mr. <UNK> .
We are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said .
`` We are going to bring the <UNK> into New York harbor safe and sound '' .
`` Of course , I agree with the Captain '' , <UNK> said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is <UNK> and desperate .
The instinct of discipline has been lost .
Anything is possible when <UNK> has the upper hand '' .
He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon .
<UNK> of wood and iron are available for close and <UNK> combat no matter where a man stands .
And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' .
`` We ourselves must stand <UNK> '' .
Alexander said .
`` Under arms day and night , watch and watch about .
Those of us present , the <UNK> brothers , <UNK> and the other <UNK> now have the responsibility of the <UNK> .
A great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' .
And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .
With all his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the <UNK> <UNK> laws .
And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul .
Where had he failed ? ?
How had he failed ? ?
He who had tried so hard , who had <UNK> so <UNK> to be a great officer .
It came to him as he wept there aboard the <UNK> that it was as foolish to <UNK> for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven .
It was given or it was not given .
One did one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward .
One did one's best and if fortune <UNK> , an <UNK> boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one's ship .
And Alexander <UNK> like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame .
God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an <UNK> rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career .
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any <UNK> .
It was for love that he had served the Navy .
To have <UNK> that love returned was what he had lived for .
Now the hope was gone .
Yes , he would bring the <UNK> safely into New York harbor but at a price .
<UNK> God , at what a price .
And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity .
<UNK> , he <UNK> the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .
The prisoners <UNK> their eyes but not before he had <UNK> hatred and anger .
Only Cromwell , the giant <UNK> , was <UNK> and <UNK> .
He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? ?
Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .
`` Are you , Cromwell '' ? ?
`` Yes , sir .
Before God I swear I am innocent .
I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' .
`` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' .
`` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' .
He leaned closer to Alexander , <UNK> up at him from the deck .
`` <UNK> , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' .
`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name .
You were careful about that '' .
Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from <UNK> , spoke .
He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth .
He is innocent '' .
Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .
The <UNK> and <UNK> of his tone suggested <UNK> of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell .
Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or <UNK> .
And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a <UNK> with Spencer .
Here was another human who understood the stupidity of <UNK> with the inevitable .
There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in <UNK> and ankle <UNK> , knew it to be a truth .
He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .
The <UNK> captain , towering above the <UNK> as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer .
This tragic <UNK> had <UNK> his own <UNK> .
But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him .
And because fortune had favored neither the <UNK> nor the <UNK> captain , they would be each other's <UNK> .
`` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? ?
He was your constant companion '' .
The <UNK> eyes met <UNK> .
`` I tell you he is innocent '' .
`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? ?
`` Yes .
I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .
`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' .
`` That's true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation .
His eyes went back to <UNK> of the sea .
`` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again .
`` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' .
And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an <UNK> , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell .
The <UNK> was as guilty as any .
No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four <UNK> , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in <UNK> hands while Spencer whispered explanations .
`` I thought '' , <UNK> Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' .
It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in <UNK> to the <UNK> , where a class of <UNK> <UNK> him .
This was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of <UNK> <UNK> here which Alexander recognized .
Some of these <UNK> were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were <UNK> followers .
Rachel <UNK> me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the <UNK> .
<UNK> of <UNK> lay in the <UNK> .
The air smelled <UNK> and <UNK> .
A young man appeared out of a side <UNK> and walked toward us with quick <UNK> .
He wore a long <UNK> coat of a heavy material , dark <UNK> , and black boots with <UNK> .
His black hat with its wide <UNK> , high crown , and fur trim rode high .
With his head erect , he approached , not <UNK> at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead .
He had a <UNK> <UNK> , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled <UNK> .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
The girls in the market place wore <UNK> dresses and covered their legs with cloth <UNK> .
I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .
His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the <UNK> market place with his back straight and , <UNK> on his heel , he entered an old stone building .
Rachel had seen me watching the young man .
She smiled .
`` When your mother was here he must have been a young boy .
Like the ones you will see now '' .
I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet <UNK> along beside Rachel .
She led me into a twisting side <UNK> .
The dirty , <UNK> buildings looked <UNK> up , and their few windows stood high above our heads .
Rachel said that schools and <UNK> occupied most of the buildings .
We entered one where the front door stood <UNK> and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor .
An old man with a white beard and dressed in a long <UNK> coat , <UNK> <UNK> , and a black <UNK> greeted us .
Rachel talked to him .
He nodded , <UNK> and <UNK> his hands over his <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> at me .
I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were <UNK> , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor .
His toes pointed out toward the walls .
He stopped in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom .
We stepped inside .
He left us .
Little boys crowded together on long wooden <UNK> , and in the center of the room sat the teacher .
His black beard <UNK> down over the front of his coat .
One white hand poised a stick above his desk .
He turned his <UNK> , <UNK> eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in <UNK> , `` One , two , three '' ! !
<UNK> the stick against the desk .
The little boys <UNK> out a <UNK> translation or interpretation of the Five <UNK> of Moses , which they had previously <UNK> in Hebrew .
They <UNK> a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .
Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and <UNK> had studied and prayed in the <UNK> of Europe .
The boys were tiny .
They had large bright eyes , the small <UNK> <UNK> of all babies everywhere , and hair <UNK> short except for the long <UNK> of <UNK> framing their little white faces .
They bent over <UNK> <UNK> and looked up only to watch the teacher .
Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for <UNK> .
The <UNK> language from the ghetto stopped .
The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , <UNK> the stick <UNK> .
One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and <UNK> .
His tightly curled <UNK> hung down to his narrow shoulders .
In the center of his brilliant <UNK> sat a small black <UNK> .
His head barely rose above the table .
I stared at him for a long time .
He did not return my interest .
My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys .
Some of them ignored the <UNK> and had apparently <UNK> the words long ago .
They <UNK> the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> them on with the stick .
The <UNK> defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake .
I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair .
His body <UNK> back and forth on the bench .
His front teeth were missing .
I <UNK> and backed out of the room .
Rachel followed , looked at me , and <UNK> with her tongue .
We walked down the cool hall silently .
From behind us came the <UNK> of the stick and the <UNK> voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer .
I said , `` How long do they keep that up '' ? ?
`` All day '' , she said .
`` Except for <UNK> , when they are <UNK> all day '' .
I rubbed my hands together .
They had turned <UNK> and <UNK> in the classroom .
The old man in the <UNK> clothes waited at the foot of the steps .
He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in <UNK> .
Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' .
She passed by him .
I reached into the pocket of my skirt , <UNK> ten <UNK> , and dropped the coin .
Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man .
He <UNK> me .
I didn't look at him .
I grinned at Rachel .
`` Does this bother you '' ? ?
I said .
She smiled to herself .
`` Most of our <UNK> think it's horrible .
When we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass .
They said that we must not fight but wait for the <UNK> '' .
I was amazed .
You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home .
You had to be stupid or crazy or <UNK> .
And I wasn't .
I was American .
You had to know , also , that you were going to fail .
All of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place .
I resented them .
Rachel faced me .
Her bright eyes were <UNK> .
She said , `` Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around .
Your mother hated this way of life .
She wished to change much for the children here '' .
I said quietly , <UNK> , `` What did she do here ? ?
In this section '' ? ?
Rachel <UNK> her tongue behind her teeth .
`` Here , nothing .
But when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the <UNK> .
She loved the children .
She was a strange woman , your mother .
When she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved .
Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted .
She stayed here to work for <UNK> .
For many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your mother .
Sometimes it was dangerous for her '' .
Rachel grinned <UNK> .
`` But she loved danger .
She took it with her wherever she went ; ;
she chose it .
And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people .
She was most strange woman .
<UNK> to follow her impulse .
It was an impulse when she was here in <UNK> <UNK> -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their <UNK> .
Here they did not need to be in <UNK> .
If she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms .
She set out to make sure that no Jewish child <UNK> in the world had to live in a place such as this '' .
I said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be <UNK> , `` Then why did she leave Israel ? ?
I'd like to know that very much '' .
Rachel <UNK> her hands together and slowed her pace .
The <UNK> of her <UNK> reported sharply on the <UNK> .
She <UNK> her lips , then <UNK> them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me .
But she sighed and her face relaxed .
`` <UNK> came into her life .
She had good friends here , people who liked her .
Who loved her .
But she had to go out and hurt herself .
There was a man here in town .
He helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted .
She worked very hard .
There was a <UNK> who was able to come here because of her .
He came with his son .
At first I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so .
This <UNK> was a <UNK> man , a big , handsome man with a <UNK> to his walk as I have never before seen .
He had the black <UNK> on his arm , so he had been <UNK> in a concentration camp .
Yet he walked like a young man .
Often he was terribly <UNK> and talked to no one .
Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe .
All his family was dead , except for his son .
Your mother would always <UNK> him when he <UNK> off , and she would send him home to his son .
He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him .
Then his son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the <UNK> -- and the son was <UNK> .
A few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed .
She ran from a little group of us .
We were sitting together , talking .
She went to the father and found he had <UNK> himself '' .
Rachel paused .
It was silent in the stone <UNK> .
Then she continued with energy , `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father .
No one saw her except the man <UNK> '' .
`` Yes '' , I said .
`` I know him '' .
Rachel gave me a direct , <UNK> look .
She said , `` <UNK> wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this <UNK> .
He said she would only hurt herself .
He complained to me once that I must talk to her .
When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that <UNK> wanted her to marry him .
I asked her if she would , and she said she would not .
He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him .
Anyway , I did not see her until two weeks after the <UNK> <UNK> himself .
She came to me one day .
She was pale and <UNK> ; ;
she was terribly alone .
And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to <UNK> and accepted his proposal .
He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself .
But now he was happy she would let him <UNK> out her life and take care of her .
He would never let her harm herself again .
For one whole week he never let her stay alone .
She let him lead her around .
He took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was .
<UNK> took her with him wherever he went .
He did not let her talk to people ; ;
he did not let her choose her own food .
She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ;
she did not care .
`` And I'll take you with me '' .
The two of them against the world .
That had been how she imagined it .
For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too .
But now the dream was over .
The big waking up had happened .
`` What did I imagine '' ? ?
She thought .
`` Did I see him about to swing low in a <UNK> ? ?
Or maybe <UNK> up the south fork of the <UNK> <UNK> River <UNK> the <UNK> dumped in it ? ?
Maybe I saw him on a <UNK> with a gang of <UNK> <UNK> it '' .
And I'll take you with me .
He had taken her all right .
Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .
Out of the church and into his big car , it <UNK> over the road with him driving and the <UNK> sweeping the <UNK> ahead and after he hit college , his <UNK> , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , <UNK> really , with a <UNK> naked light <UNK> in the ceiling ( <UNK> and naked as a <UNK> , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the <UNK> <UNK> in after the <UNK> , watching in between your <UNK> at <UNK> ) , a room complete with <UNK> <UNK> the light and the few casual <UNK> <UNK> the walls , an insect <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> waving .
And the bed that <UNK> in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for <UNK> talk in the next room when <UNK> went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .
And <UNK> <UNK> would be in Memphis today for the wedding <UNK> and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .
Like <UNK> and the mayor up there <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> back in his office <UNK> out teeth , like they all knew he would .
Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a <UNK> or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen .
Or you could hope the <UNK> wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to <UNK> <UNK> in his suit of red <UNK> , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be <UNK> , but must stand the <UNK> feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I'm <UNK> '' .
You could wish that .
Or you could wish your <UNK> would really do it -- kill <UNK> <UNK> like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve <UNK> out of him like air out of a <UNK> tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is <UNK> and at night .
So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the <UNK> , waiting for you , for your new spectator <UNK> , waiting for you to <UNK> by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned <UNK> tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , <UNK> to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .
And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has <UNK> you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , <UNK> her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .
It is not having his baby <UNK> warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK> .
And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he <UNK> a bread truck or <UNK> the mail or checks the <UNK> <UNK> down at the <UNK> , or owns seventeen oil <UNK> and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .
He can even be a <UNK> <UNK> guy with <UNK> ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even <UNK> couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked .
And he can be on the way to Memphis , your <UNK> <UNK> can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead .
Because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him .
For you don't share him , not even with God .
If it is love , you don't .
And I'll take you with me .
Even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie .
Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you .
And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .
You feel him every mile further away .
You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't .
And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the <UNK> who begged you to marry him , the one with the <UNK> hair and the car he couldn't afford and the <UNK> shoes .
You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? ?
It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have <UNK> <UNK> ; ;
that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy .
It <UNK> on you that instead of a <UNK> to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because <UNK> <UNK> was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to <UNK> <UNK> substitute , that other guy .
And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .
You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .
You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you .
`` <UNK> the world '' , she thought .
She looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the <UNK> fence <UNK> the grounds .
The mayor <UNK> factories there .
<UNK> and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the <UNK> and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments .
The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .
The others , the ones in the stands , were <UNK> , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City .
It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano <UNK> <UNK> .
He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day .
So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling .
If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever .
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .
It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it .
You laughed and then your chest <UNK> and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> along your arm .
He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .
While he talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , <UNK> enough to wet a <UNK> <UNK> .
She glanced at the man <UNK> beside her , a man with weather <UNK> <UNK> into his lean cheeks , with <UNK> pale eyes reflecting all the <UNK> he had seen , reflecting the sky and the <UNK> which must follow now in August -- yes , with eyes <UNK> the <UNK> and here it was only June , only festival time again and thoughts of <UNK> <UNK> would not leave her .
`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought .
Back at the <UNK> with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was <UNK> , which made her young enough to <UNK> the usual ideal working conditions , like the <UNK> toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .
There was no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock .
A lock on the toilet would encourage <UNK> and <UNK> .
The toilet hadn't had a sincere <UNK> in years and there were things written on the walls of the little <UNK> place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely .
She could not count the times Herman had <UNK> on the door , just a couple of <UNK> that shook the whole damned closet and might , <UNK> , break away the pipe connections from the wall .
The two little <UNK> meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would <UNK> open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , <UNK> clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot .
And the hours were <UNK> in the morning until eleven at night on <UNK> and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no <UNK> or <UNK> .
Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies <UNK> to magazine work and quick <UNK> jobs .
Each of us had his own <UNK> besides .
George did wonderful complicated <UNK> drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details <UNK> into an <UNK> sheet and looking as if they had been done under a <UNK> glass .
He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic <UNK> , The New <UNK> , for instance , or <UNK> .
I did book <UNK> and covers for <UNK> <UNK> : naked girls <UNK> in corners of <UNK> furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .
The book could be The <UNK> <UNK> , but it would still have the same jacket illustration .
I remember once I did a jacket for <UNK> Press ; ;
the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the <UNK> <UNK> , furnishings , clothes .
I even <UNK> out the materials from which <UNK> were made -- <UNK> wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light <UNK> accurate .
<UNK> , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing doing , <UNK> .
In the first place , it's static ; ;
in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ;
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to <UNK> in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold '' .
I said , `` Mr. <UNK> , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' .
He said , `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think .
They know from their <UNK> into television and the movies that <UNK> in the middle ages had beautiful flowing <UNK> like Little Lord <UNK> , and only the <UNK> had <UNK> .
And girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough '' .
In the end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a <UNK> instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the <UNK> of a costume movie .
<UNK> was as happy as a <UNK> .
`` That's <UNK> '' , he said .
As for Donald , he actually sold paintings .
We all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as <UNK> painters with <UNK> , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it .
Not much ; ;
he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce <UNK> or her friends .
He had style , a real inner vision of his very own .
It was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults .
There was the <UNK> of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of <UNK> , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and <UNK> you in the eye .
We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so <UNK> .
It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the <UNK> of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting .
He also had , at times , an <UNK> <UNK> air like a <UNK> ; ;
he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got <UNK> blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well .
Mrs. <UNK> thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .
It was all <UNK> , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ;
none of us did .
We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap <UNK> of one kind or another .
<UNK> the life class was my idea -- or rather , <UNK> idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it .
I wanted to paint again .
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year .
It wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself .
It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting .
I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an <UNK> -- like Peter <UNK> , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint '' .
<UNK> was a kind of goal I set myself ; ;
I had admired him long before I talked to him .
It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income .
The night we first met , at one of Mrs. <UNK> giant parties , he was wearing a brown <UNK> jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink <UNK> shirt ; ;
instead of a <UNK> he wore a leather <UNK> drawn through a golden ring in which was set a <UNK> of pale pure <UNK> .
This set his tone : <UNK> of texture and color , and another kind of <UNK> as well , for his clothing and <UNK> would have paid the <UNK> rent for a year .
He was fifteen years older than I -- <UNK> -- but full of spring and <UNK> .
He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man , and his lively and <UNK> speech made him seem even younger .
He was one of the most prominent magazine <UNK> in America ; ;
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the <UNK> national magazines every month .
Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had <UNK> him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ;
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have <UNK> in it painting the <UNK> of <UNK> .
I had a long talk with him .
We went into Mrs. <UNK> library , which had low <UNK> all along the walls , and above them a <UNK> portrait , a Jackson <UNK> twelve feet long , and a <UNK> <UNK> with a yellow background , that looked like an <UNK> from a <UNK> tomb .
The <UNK> had <UNK> made for Mrs. <UNK> by Picasso himself .
Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself .
In the course of our talk , <UNK> mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
I asked .
`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said .
`` I don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft .
Besides , it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as <UNK> went to Italy to meet <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
`` <UNK> isn't this big , you know .
It doesn't embrace only the artist , alone before his <UNK> .
It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , <UNK> '' .
He threw his arms wide , his face shining .
`` The artist is like a <UNK> of a <UNK> -- no , he is more than that , a <UNK> <UNK> in some vast <UNK> .
One of these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract <UNK> to extreme <UNK> , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other .
The eye is all , inward or outward .
Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The <UNK> is All '' ! !
`` What do you study '' ? ?
I asked .
I was <UNK> ; ;
just listening to him made me feel intelligent .
`` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied .
`` Maybe you know him .
He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art '' .
I nodded .
I had studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the <UNK> prize for my paintings of <UNK> on Hudson Street .
Burns and I had not loved each other .
`` I'm also studying <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> <UNK> '' ? ?
I said .
`` My God , is he still alive ? ?
He must be a million years old .
I went to a <UNK> of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of <UNK> '' .
`` Not quite '' .
<UNK> laughed .
`` He's about sixty , now .
Still painting , still a kind of modern <UNK> , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms .
He even makes the city look like one of <UNK> <UNK> .
I've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class '' .
`` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an <UNK> painter '' ? ?
`` You're missing the point '' , he said .
`` He has the magical eye .
And he is a great man .
<UNK> with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
They lack stimulation .
They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in <UNK> themselves still farther from life .
That's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .
In the Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .
He was an <UNK> , a man who studied his trade and developed his <UNK> the way a <UNK> or a wood <UNK> did .
He filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , <UNK> its wars and its leaders , its <UNK> and its <UNK> , reflecting its profound religious impulses .
He was a <UNK> -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- <UNK> , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .
But look at us today ! !
We hold safe little jobs <UNK> <UNK> ads or the <UNK> incidents in trivial novels , and most of our <UNK> painting is nothing but picking the <UNK> out of the <UNK> so it can be <UNK> in greater purity .
A bunch of amateur <UNK> ! !
What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and <UNK> , to the cafe and the school '' .
He could certainly talk .
The <UNK> of the evening was that I got the address of <UNK> studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .
It was an awkward hour , but I didn't have to <UNK> any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .
After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the <UNK> reading out to work .
It was mostly for the benefit of the <UNK> , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .
In a way , <UNK> was right .
`` <UNK> '' was the word for it .
I don't know that it was always as <UNK> as I had expected it to be .
<UNK> , it was because <UNK> himself wasn't what I anticipated .
I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead <UNK> .
No , that isn't quite fair .
Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of <UNK> after a week .
Such a little thing to start with -- the car registration .
`` <UNK> , where is the car license '' ? ?
She asked .
`` I can't find it in the glove compartment '' .
`` Via must have it '' , I answered readily enough , <UNK> her last visit .
`` Via '' , she was frowning .
`` Why should Via have it '' ? ?
Had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? ?
I was silent .
I didn't want to <UNK> things up .
`` I drive my own car by <UNK> of Via '' ? ?
`` I'm sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather .
You know that '' .
She looked as if she were <UNK> me of some <UNK> .
`` She must have taken the registration when she went to <UNK> .
I'll call her '' .
`` No , thank you .
I want nothing of <UNK> '' .
Why should this suddenly <UNK> her ? ?
Walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills .
Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ?
`` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly .
`` I knew all this , but I paid no attention .
I don't even own the house I'm standing in .
I was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things
`` It <UNK> down down down and finally there is no way out .
If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' .
I suppose I should have paid attention to that <UNK> remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in .
I love you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living .
So I went about my business .
I made a lemon <UNK> , a light <UNK> , <UNK> a chicken , <UNK> some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the <UNK> for the weekend .
`` Don't bother , <UNK> '' , she said .
`` I have these <UNK> in town for Saturday , and I'll probably spend Sunday with <UNK> or the <UNK> '' .
At last , I thought , she's <UNK> her spirits .
With this <UNK> in London , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more <UNK> , a <UNK> person , all the better for her stay out here .
I felt more cheerful , as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself .
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life .
It was <UNK> that evening , but the path to my house was so well <UNK> that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense <UNK> that rise from the <UNK> <UNK> of the river and sometimes last for days .
In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my <UNK> full on .
I did notice a <UNK> of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town .
I did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas <UNK> , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon .
But the next day -- Sunday .
Why , when I drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear ? ?
<UNK> brought to the <UNK> accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , <UNK> .
When I came back from church at noon Mrs. <UNK> was turning into the Salter driveway .
Even at a <UNK> length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the <UNK> in front of the house .
<UNK> <UNK> was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us .
`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !
She screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and I followed .
The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening <UNK> , talking , <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> .
Everything was as I had left it the night before last -- her <UNK> and bag for town , her <UNK> and dress and shoes laid out only her <UNK> coat was missing .
And she .
Then the <UNK> began .
I , who until that day before had been Mrs. <UNK> friend , her equal , was the servant now .
It was <UNK> and Mrs. <UNK> who were calling Via , everybody .
And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me .
And after I brought them <UNK> and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait .
<UNK> in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me .
`` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing '' .
Why didn't that alarm me then ? ?
And when she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was <UNK> <UNK> this , <UNK> that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing '' ? ?
And then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself '' .
I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check .
The last night I had called , but the line was always busy and it <UNK> me .
I assumed it was one of those <UNK> conversations with <UNK> or <UNK> , she comfortable in bed .
But it seemed not from what they were saying .
Then was it a final desperate plea from her , to whom ? ?
<UNK> on and on past any man's patience some final <UNK> of conclusion ? ?
She was found the day after at the bottom of the <UNK> .
I tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing .
Sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the <UNK> .
It's so romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river <UNK> in its <UNK> like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic .
With all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a <UNK> rock , a <UNK> .
But I didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else .
When a <UNK> brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to <UNK> with a terrible excitement , almost <UNK> , that I still cannot account for .
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of <UNK> of those weeks ? ?
That at last the <UNK> , the will gives way ? ?
Or what was it that , before Via , <UNK> , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with <UNK> and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it ! !
I knew '' ! !
Everyone stared at me and drew back .
Their eyes turned cold and <UNK> , even <UNK> .
And they have never changed .
At the same time that I thought I understood her at long last and <UNK> her , <UNK> this knowing had there burned <UNK> by my pity a fire of hate , an enduring <UNK> that burst out in that <UNK> <UNK> ? ?
Was that what had given way in me ? ?
Even now I am <UNK> at how little anyone knows of what they really are .
It is absurd of course to say that that one <UNK> <UNK> me from the family I considered my very own , but there it <UNK> , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other .
At the time I was filled with <UNK> at this separation , but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that <UNK> .
In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a <UNK> for what is not to be <UNK> .
It is not their <UNK> that <UNK> ; ;
it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so <UNK> and walk away , that it <UNK> .
I could tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so <UNK> at the sight of her body .
No , I forget Mrs. <UNK> , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened .
She haunted me ; ;
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .
`` We all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her <UNK> .
`` It was <UNK> fault .
She <UNK> her hand '' .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
She <UNK> .
`` Why put such a high value on being top dog '' ? ?
I added .
It was coarse , almost <UNK> , this harsh <UNK> , and she has never come to see me since .
But suppose she had not taken Mrs. <UNK> advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , <UNK> of love , hanging on to <UNK> , and altogether and finally <UNK> .
If she chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her <UNK> height , and <UNK> her <UNK> self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision ? ?
If they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of <UNK> , her search into herself and its conclusions .
Yes , I had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> -- and guilt .
She was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice .
At rest with my darling Ellen , the first Mrs. Salter .
Mr. Salter came home .
The funeral service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and <UNK> his <UNK> and his neat body standing beside that <UNK> with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to <UNK> the old sacred words , and the rain <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> , seven days of <UNK> rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed .
I waited .
Then Via called to say they had decided to <UNK> her -- as they had Ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning .
The <UNK> stood on <UNK> in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the <UNK> of white <UNK> I had ordered .
I knelt , just for decency I thought at the time , but found myself <UNK> , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief .
Via was in the parking lot when I went outside .
<UNK> we waited in her car until the <UNK> moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey .
By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the <UNK> <UNK> with its <UNK> symbols of religious <UNK> .
Again I felt <UNK> to <UNK> , and reached back and pulled Via down .
Something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of <UNK> would give her some <UNK> .
`` I had a rather small place of my own .
A nice <UNK> apartment in a place called the <UNK> <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left <UNK> .
`` And then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' .
`` <UNK> '' .
`` I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him .
`` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people .
I think I was what you might call a <UNK> man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive .
But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .
<UNK> , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .
She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little .
`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ?
`` Me '' ? ?
She asked , turning slowly .
`` What about me '' ? ?
`` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
`` <UNK> , <UNK> '' .
`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot .
How about it '' ? ?
`` I guess so '' , she said taking a <UNK> from her purse .
When she had wiped some of the <UNK> from her mouth , she stared <UNK> at her image in the mirror .
`` Are your people still alive '' ? ?
He asked , trying to touch a part of her life <UNK> hadn't discussed ; ;
so he could have something of her for himself .
`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on .
`` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to <UNK> her <UNK> .
`` You must have been good at history at school .
Where did you go to school '' ? ?
`` What is this '' ? ?
She asked , turning suddenly .
`` Don't you know all about me by this time ? ?
My <UNK> Carla <UNK> .
This is my town .
I sleep with you .
You know something more about me every day , don't you ? ?
Would you be happier if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? ?
Why are you trying to worry me '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to worry you '' .
`` Well , all right then '' .
The <UNK> tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .
At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance .
Was she just naturally <UNK> about everything but her physical appearance ? ?
He wondered .
Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her <UNK> , make the bed while she lay around ? ?
He straightened up , ready to vent his <UNK> , then grew afraid .
If he <UNK> on the <UNK> he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
She asked suddenly .
`` Nothing .
Nothing at all '' , he said quietly .
`` Let's go out '' .
`` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ? ?
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
`` The heavy thick <UNK> .
Look at them '' .
`` They're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot .
I like them '' .
`` Sam , no one around here <UNK> such heavy <UNK> .
Can't you get another pair '' ? ?
`` Maybe I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him .
`` I'll get an elegant pair of <UNK> Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' .
`` And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face .
`` What's the matter with it '' ? ?
He had put on the gray jacket and the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street .
`` Oh , Sam .
You look like a <UNK> Englishman .
Can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ? ?
`` I don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .
<UNK> his clothes , he put on his <UNK> <UNK> suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good .
But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .
She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in <UNK> .
That day they <UNK> around , just getting the feel of the city .
They looked at the <UNK> of the old Roman wall on the lower Via <UNK> , then they went to the <UNK> Gardens .
She had some amusing <UNK> about the <UNK> in the old days .
Then they took a taxi to <UNK> .
`` There's a church you should see '' , she said .
And when they stood by the fountain in the <UNK> looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with <UNK> .
He let her tell him all about the church .
Then they had dinner .
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
When they got home at midnight she was tired out .
And in the morning when he woke up at ten the church <UNK> were ringing .
He had never heard so many <UNK> , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her <UNK> him for his remarks when he had looked up at the <UNK> and the church at the top of the Spanish <UNK> .
It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought .
She might like to take him to St. Peter's .
`` Carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her .
`` It's ten o'clock .
<UNK> you going out to mass ? ?
You could take me to St. Peter's '' .
`` <UNK> '' , she muttered .
`` Come on , you'll be late '' .
`` I think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said <UNK> , and as she <UNK> against him , he wondered if she ever went to church .
Why did he want her to go to church ? ?
He wondered Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .
It would be good for her .
It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church .
Not his poor mother's fault .
She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible .
As for himself , he just didn't have the <UNK> for it .
From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain <UNK> and <UNK> by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know .
Then he thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the <UNK> Chapel .
Just figures out of a <UNK> folklore .
Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old <UNK> <UNK> her imagination now ? ?
Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church .
It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself .
Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing <UNK> <UNK> , or a strict orthodox Communist .
What was the matter with him that they all <UNK> him ? ?
It was the times , he was sure .
All the <UNK> changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an <UNK> of his freedom ? ?
It was all too <UNK> .
Look somewhere else .
But where ? ?
Just the same , he thought , <UNK> over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church .
A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the <UNK> , hearing them <UNK> down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass .
It seemed to him that if the <UNK> felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla .
`` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .
And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam .
There's so little to do '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
She said .
`` I'm not good at that kind of thing '' .
`` This afternoon let's take an air with them .
Let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were <UNK> .
`` If you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the <UNK> .
`` I am what I am .
I can't help it '' .
Her words remained with him , <UNK> him for hours .
He didn't know how she would behave with other people .
When they walked into the <UNK> apartment , the old lady , <UNK> and smiling , said softly .
`` <UNK> , '' and put out her hand .
Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes <UNK> , and with her little <UNK> she said all the <UNK> things .
<UNK> , smiling too , said , `` <UNK> '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' .
And they sat down and began their little coffee party .
The <UNK> offered them <UNK> with the coffee .
Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal .
She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again .
<UNK> her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth .
<UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> her head <UNK> , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest .
Carla translated .
The old woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the <UNK> unemployment , and who had <UNK> to Canada to work on the railway .
For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a <UNK> .
Did many of <UNK> <UNK> live in <UNK> in the bush ? ?
Had Sam ever lived in a <UNK> ? ?
She wanted to know .
<UNK> Sam explained that he had no experience with <UNK> .
Just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his <UNK> and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country .
And Sam <UNK> her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope .
A very great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes <UNK> .
An intellectual .
But very <UNK> too .
It was said that he had had a vision .
Just as thousands that day in <UNK> had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to <UNK> for <UNK> .
<UNK> had been sitting quietly , listening with the <UNK> of the unaware .
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and <UNK> in her eyes .
The Holy Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world .
Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint .
No , he was indeed a saint now .
<UNK> <UNK> and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered <UNK> .
There was a certain discontent among the <UNK> .
The Pope , in the <UNK> of his great <UNK> , had neglected them a little .
There would be changes made , and <UNK> Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome .
<UNK> would be lost and new faces would become prominent .
Did <UNK> Raymond understand ? ?
Indeed he did , Sam said <UNK> , trying to get <UNK> eye .
<UNK> she could see that these women were her <UNK> , too , he thought .
<UNK> , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or <UNK> or Ireland .
But <UNK> eyes were on <UNK> whose glowing face and <UNK> eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness .
And Carla , watching in wonder , turned to Sam .
`` It means so much to her .
It's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a <UNK> tone .
But one night <UNK> moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where <UNK> of Night had gone to <UNK> herself .
With the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill <UNK> the <UNK> with his lips , making it whisper .
He saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her <UNK> fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme <UNK> and indifference she would pass by all the <UNK> looks of those whom she might approach .
In her dark , <UNK> fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding .
Seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart <UNK> in him , and turned away , afraid now .
Even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil <UNK> in her <UNK> more .
His breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off .
<UNK> , he saw as often before some <UNK> , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the <UNK> when they are perhaps pressed by the <UNK> .
He cried out to her , his back turned .
Then he fled , not waiting to see if she <UNK> him or took notice of his cry .
But she heard him go .
Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp .
<UNK> others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their <UNK> then gathering in small , curious <UNK> .
Early Spring came from her bed , from beside her <UNK> husband , <UNK> , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild <UNK> , the sound of <UNK> voices .
<UNK> there she saw <UNK> of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost <UNK> , her body <UNK> , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of <UNK> waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .
When at last she could suffer the <UNK> no longer , nor face the girl's <UNK> , she said in a voice <UNK> :
`` I shall call your father ! !
Go back where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! !
But the girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come '' .
And it was not <UNK> of <UNK> she meant .
But now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , Early Spring stood like a she <UNK> before her <UNK> and cried , `` I will not <UNK> at you ! !
I will tell you to go , not begging .
<UNK> you '' ! !
And <UNK> the knife she used for <UNK> <UNK> she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side .
`` You bring only <UNK> '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the <UNK> hunger of a wild animal .
Speaking in a low voice of <UNK> she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , <UNK> bearing and did not even look at the knife .
`` Go take <UNK> , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said .
`` They do not have to face battle .
I will not let your evil in .
I will simply kill you first .
Now go '' ! !
The other women had come close now , their voices <UNK> together until they stood <UNK> in an angry <UNK> , their threats <UNK> , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt .
They picked up sticks and <UNK> them at the girl .
The sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them <UNK> her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her <UNK> .
They were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought .
But she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old <UNK> of her extreme youth until suddenly <UNK> of <UNK> came <UNK> among them , swinging a great <UNK> whip .
`` Go back to your <UNK> '' ! !
He shouted .
`` A pack of dogs makes less noise '' ! !
He made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some <UNK> over themselves in their flight .
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
`` If you must <UNK> someone , let it be her , your daughter .
Drive the <UNK> out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! !
But the old man turned on her , <UNK> the whip from her hand .
`` Get into your <UNK> '' ! !
He spat .
`` Go back to that <UNK> man of yours who so <UNK> his fine body among the young women .
Keep him back , if you must tell me what to do .
I will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! !
She retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where <UNK> stirred , <UNK> , sitting up in a half <UNK> to say :
`` What <UNK> thing happens ? ?
I thought I dreamed of <UNK> fighting '' .
But she went to him and pressed herself against his <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> odor of the whisky he had stolen from <UNK> .
She said , `` There is nothing that concerns you here .
<UNK> back and go to sleep .
But do not dream .
Do not let the <UNK> spirits enter your brain '' .
He sank back , <UNK> , and was soon asleep again .
Outside , the old man , beyond all the <UNK> of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the <UNK> <UNK> of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her <UNK> ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms .
And , <UNK> her against a <UNK> , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it <UNK> and crack in the damp air , <UNK> its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it <UNK> and cracked , settling its own cruel <UNK> on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and <UNK> as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale <UNK> of the bark so close to her face .
She said to him , her father , `` How was I <UNK> , in pain or joy ? ?
Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ?
They all know your foolish name '' ! !
She stared at the pale <UNK> on the tree , hearing her breath <UNK> from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark .
She felt the <UNK> bite and heard her father say in <UNK> <UNK> words which had no meaning , like , `` <UNK> ! !
<UNK> '' ! !
The sounds of an animal in rage and despair .
Suddenly the <UNK> stopped fighting the air and she heard <UNK> of <UNK> say in his high , <UNK> voice :
`` Did you follow me to see my shame ? ?
<UNK> from the line or I will settle the whip on you .
<UNK> ! !
Do you hear the anger of the <UNK> <UNK> '' ? ?
Turning , the girl saw <UNK> standing between , his narrow shoulders <UNK> , his arms hanging long and resigned .
He said , `` Let me take her blows , for there are <UNK> in me too '' .
Then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , <UNK> her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and <UNK> , listening to the <UNK> of her heart and wanting for once to cry .
For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of <UNK> , <UNK> in his harsh language as he talked with himself .
He shouted like a <UNK> old <UNK> , his hair stiff and <UNK> .
He <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , <UNK> <UNK> until finally , <UNK> and sick , he fell into his own <UNK> .
He amused the young men who had been silent long enough .
But they could taste the <UNK> of violence and <UNK> through his <UNK> .
Now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , <UNK> the gloom they saw in the faces around them .
They came out and held their games and races .
It was they who held the future in their hands .
They went into the sun together and <UNK> <UNK> in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred <UNK> dug far off in the cave of <UNK> .
They danced the <UNK> wildly at night , the war dance , and <UNK> their <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> and rode their horses in swift <UNK> , firing their few guns in <UNK> at some <UNK> signal .
<UNK> was among them , and <UNK> , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing .
And a very young one , <UNK> <UNK> , tried to <UNK> them and followed <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the <UNK> <UNK> of youth worked .
He would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with <UNK> , because something had boiled over in his <UNK> <UNK> .
All the young men , <UNK> among them , challenged them in matched racing .
They raced and <UNK> for war , swinging their horses in single file and then <UNK> like cavalry .
At times they would ride <UNK> through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their <UNK> .
Then again they would stand in circles making other preparations .
They <UNK> their hair and <UNK> it at the part and <UNK> the <UNK> so that the hair above their <UNK> stood rigid like the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> making love .
<UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees .
He saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a <UNK> arrow from the <UNK> bow , <UNK> with a mad grace , his <UNK> shining and <UNK> with meadow <UNK> .
He was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , <UNK> him .
And the suspicious , <UNK> eyes of <UNK> of <UNK> .
And those of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and <UNK> .
He felt so much like laughing ; ;
even like shouting and crying out from the <UNK> from which he could <UNK> as an <UNK> in a mad <UNK> from the <UNK> .
He and <UNK> planned a great parade with the young men .
They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their <UNK> .
They would ride with <UNK> <UNK> , their colors <UNK> in the sun , shouting the last <UNK> of a nation in the <UNK> of death .
And so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and <UNK> which ran with their hearts .
They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .
The ,
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening .
The sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> , horses the white men once had called the <UNK> of Hell .
He saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge .
<UNK> then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , <UNK> <UNK> , their hair flying like dark <UNK> , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad <UNK> of the <UNK> accompanying them .
They leaned into the wind and seemed like one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> until suddenly they rose straight in their <UNK> and in one <UNK> voice shouted , <UNK> their grotesque cry of war .
She was moving through a screen of <UNK> , in among the white <UNK> and <UNK> .
The sounds from the <UNK> began to pulse in her ears .
She stood , once more listening .
She had never been here at this hour .
She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would <UNK> at her arm ; ;
but she found the path she always used , the <UNK> of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ;
and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark <UNK> of water beneath her .
If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days .
She smiled , and <UNK> let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her <UNK> sliding in the leaves .
She jumped out onto the flat <UNK> of rock and , <UNK> herself , shook her <UNK> brown hair and tilted her chin far upward .
The <UNK> music of the <UNK> had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was <UNK> .
Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and <UNK> her hands tightly around the bent knees .
She had accomplished a miracle .
This was her place .
The hour couldn't change it .
Only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange .
They were becoming confused .
Perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now .
She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago , in the Easter holidays , with her at one of those awful Friday <UNK> <UNK> Class parties her mother had made her attend .
`` <UNK> , Julie , how are you '' ? ?
And then off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a <UNK> dress , someone without a <UNK> of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him .
I wish he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only <UNK> and acute <UNK> .
Oh God ! !
I wish I were older or younger , Julia <UNK> thought .
I wish so much someone loved me .
George <UNK> remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- <UNK> , in a white <UNK> , standing like a ghost at the threshold .
She had vanished ; ;
he must have slept again .
He was staring at the blue <UNK> lamp left on beside him .
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ;
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning .
This room was like a prison .
He would not be indebted to Sam ! !
Below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the <UNK> of a vacuum cleaner .
His fingers <UNK> across the <UNK> .
They had left both of his eyes <UNK> .
Well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road .
He was walking across to the bathroom .
He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands .
A fearful pain had come from his head , as if the water were <UNK> up through the blood vessels and expanding them .
He recognized his jacket and <UNK> .
The fabric was dark ; ;
the stains weren't too apparent ; ;
and there were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess .
He <UNK> , and then tore away the <UNK> parts and wound the rest around his neck like a <UNK> .
Sam would be amazed to find him gone .
<UNK> would have to understand .
She must have put his clothes in the closet .
He found a <UNK> rising in his throat because of that one simple act of <UNK> .
He was on the <UNK> of tears .
Alex <UNK> -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that <UNK> gentleman .
At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying .
Perhaps George <UNK> would be better off dead .
What time was it ? ?
He peered at his <UNK> .
<UNK> , it was still running .
A quarter to seven .
Too early for a vacuum cleaner , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs .
He was <UNK> to tie his <UNK> .
His fingers felt <UNK> thick and <UNK> .
He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door .
He barely knew himself .
This was some <UNK> , two <UNK> of <UNK> tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of <UNK> , suddenly moist over his <UNK> .
The surface , however , was perfectly white .
He was drinking another glass of water .
It was after seven o'clock .
He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall .
Who would take over ? ?
He'd have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before Sam <UNK> was up and about , and before <UNK> <UNK> him with sympathy .
He entered the <UNK> .
He was actually walking down the stairs .
A plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this <UNK> <UNK> of a man desperately trying to get away .
`` Father , is that you '' ? ?
The voice issued from the <UNK> of the hall below .
George did not reply .
`` Is that you , Father ? ?
Who's there '' ? ?
For a moment he felt like a <UNK> discovered .
Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room .
She stood <UNK> at him .
`` Uncle George '' ! !
He was trying to smile at her .
`` <UNK> ! !
You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ?
`` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie .
I'm all set .
Just about to call a taxi '' .
She was wearing some sort of gray <UNK> .
She seemed <UNK> tall , her <UNK> <UNK> in concern .
`` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying .
`` I'm about to leave myself .
I'll drop you off '' .
`` You're leaving '' ? ?
`` I'm going back to school '' , she answered .
`` <UNK> driving me .
I'm just finishing breakfast .
But have you told Mother you were going '' ? ?
She asked him .
`` No .
I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie .
That's my wish .
It's quite a big one '' , he added .
Her face seemed to <UNK> in an <UNK> bright shaft of sunlight .
`` Well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ?
Or maybe a drink '' ? ?
She asked , in a way that seemed <UNK> sophisticated , <UNK> , and yet perhaps partly <UNK> .
He tried to see her face more clearly .
`` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` I'll just wait for you here '' .
He leaned his head against the wood <UNK> behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his <UNK> .
He raised them .
Julia moved past .
`` I have to say <UNK> upstairs .
I won't be long '' .
`` As a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me '' .
`` Not to anyone '' ? ?
`` No -- please .
`` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home .
It'll be so much easier '' .
`` All right '' She was staring at him .
`` I'm fine , Julie .
Please , you just go ahead '' .
She had disappeared .
He could feel a pulse <UNK> against the <UNK> .
He imagined <UNK> voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? ?
I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought .
Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi .
He could hear the footsteps overhead .
He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding .
He stood up .
`` I'll take that , Julie -- for you '' .
`` Oh no '' , she said .
`` I can manage '' .
She went ahead of him .
Outside the Lincoln was parked .
He could hardly believe he was getting in .
<UNK> was <UNK> at him in an <UNK> , <UNK> fashion ; ;
but that didn't matter .
We'll drop Mr. <UNK> off in <UNK> '' , Julia said , and for the <UNK> second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants .
To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ;
yet her <UNK> seemed forced or <UNK> .
He could not stop to analyze .
He had never felt particularly close to her .
<UNK> seemed more <UNK> , but obviously Julia had respected his request .
He took her hand .
`` I wish I didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` I wish you lived in New York .
That's in the opposite direction '' .
`` I wish I did '' , he responded .
`` I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking .
`` <UNK> we ever knew what '' ? ?
`` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' .
She said nothing until <UNK> had <UNK> their pace .
`` I know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a <UNK> thing for you to say '' .
`` Does it '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Yes , perhaps .
I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ?
But sometimes life can be rather a <UNK> business '' .
His voice seemed thick and <UNK> .
He <UNK> her hand .
He could see the stone building where he lived .
Just a few more steps .
<UNK> he reached into his pocket .
Yes , there was the key .
`` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ?
She asked him .
For a moment he smiled .
`` Yes , Julie dear .
You've done me the greatest possible service .
By myself I'll be fine '' .
`` Take care of yourself then '' .
`` I will .
You , also .
Don't work too hard '' .
It was an automatic phrase ; ;
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it .
He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! !
Will you look at George <UNK> ! !
What happened to you '' ? ?
`` I <UNK> into a door handle '' , George said .
Someone laughed .
George walked steadily ahead into his entry .
His <UNK> seemed on fire .
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it .
In the <UNK> the raw whiskey made him <UNK> .
Just one or two <UNK> , he told himself , enough to <UNK> some of the pain .
He was <UNK> .
`` No , <UNK> , I'm home .
No , really , right as rain .
Tell Sam not to worry about the car .
I'll get it hauled away .
No , please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep .
For God's sake , don't worry .
That <UNK> me more than anything .
Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist .
''
There was one more call to make .
`` Joan , did I wake you '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up .
Look , sweetheart , some fool was .
<UNK> to be driving somewhat <UNK> last night .
Unfortunately it turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss .
Oh hell no , I'm not in a hospital .
I won't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon .
Too bad a jury isn't involved .
I might struggle in for a jury .
I'd win hands down .
But I thought maybe Tony <UNK> could <UNK> for me .
He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a <UNK> <UNK> .
He's got all the facts .
I wouldn't want to ask for a <UNK> -- it's really just a routine thing .
What ? ?
No , darling I'd rather you didn't come out '' .
A smile pulled at the lower strip of <UNK> tape .
`` Don't even send flowers .
I'll see you Wednesday .
I'll <UNK> you with a nice '' -- He was about to say `` double <UNK> '' but thought better of it .
`` I'll take you out to dinner .
Okay ? ?
''
He had put down the receiver .
A strange relationship between Joan <UNK> and himself .
Who knew about it ? ?
She lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those <UNK> houses whose brick <UNK> some early <UNK> had constructed .
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor .
She was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary .
She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her .
In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ;
yet if he said : Make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her .
`` They make us <UNK> look good '' .
`` That's a peculiar way to think '' .
It wasn't just the <UNK> birds that had <UNK> her own feathers , of course ; ;
she knew that .
It was <UNK> `` little '' sister Myra , the <UNK> , irresponsible , forever <UNK> , Myra .
She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself .
`` Come , come '' , Jim said , <UNK> Lucy a little .
`` I love you .
Susan ready '' ? ?
Lucy listened .
Obviously , Susan was not .
<UNK> , busy feet , <UNK> like <UNK> , <UNK> around her room .
Susan would be visiting her <UNK> for only a few days , but even at seven she was a <UNK> soul ; ;
she always packed for a lifetime , just in case .
`` Not yet .
Every doll in the house must be going with her '' .
`` She'd better step on it .
It's a long way to <UNK> '' .
<UNK> fine young face was an <UNK> one , too ; ;
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety .
`` You know '' , he said .
`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy .
It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' .
Lucy did not believe him ; ;
Myra appreciated nothing .
Jim had put the thanks in his <UNK> mouth .
`` <UNK> '' -- she said , and the single word <UNK> love and <UNK> in an equal blend .
`` She should have told me herself .
And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ?
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ?
Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ;
but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them .
Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if <UNK> , <UNK> husband , hadn't gone out to <UNK> her .
`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' .
For an otherwise silent moment , <UNK> keys <UNK> <UNK> in his pocket .
`` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last .
`` You've got to admit she was smart to <UNK> up this fine government job over there -- <UNK> get a home for herself and Cathy in no time .
You'll see , <UNK> settling down '' .
On the defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' .
`` It depends on the widow '' .
Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it .
And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down .
It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .
<UNK> that succession of <UNK> , she now considered Cathy , an ominous <UNK> on her horizon .
It was not that she disliked Cathy .
The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ;
whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or <UNK> , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra .
But Cathy was <UNK> responsibility , not hers .
`` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said <UNK> , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' .
Myra loved big cities ; ;
thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother .
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .
`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! !
Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming <UNK> of a <UNK> .
He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , <UNK> , `` Susan ! !
Susan ! !
Get moving '' ! !
A startled <UNK> sound returned .
`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said .
Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the <UNK> river ? ?
Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ;
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as <UNK> in light , as the air around them .
Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had <UNK> ; ;
Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line .
Jim turned back from the <UNK> and looked at her .
His dark <UNK> , which had been lowered in anger , <UNK> .
`` Please '' , he said .
`` There isn't a chance of <UNK> letting anything like that happen .
Let's stay friends '' .
But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ;
they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right <UNK> and <UNK> their marriage .
The only thing that had ever come between them was that <UNK> , <UNK> sister of his .
Lucy was sick of it .
`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was <UNK> down the stairs .
Susan looked like an <UNK> baby nurse ; ;
her arms were <UNK> with a burden of dolls .
`` I'm ready '' , she announced .
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ?
Jim said .
His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment .
`` All that junk '' ? ?
Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that <UNK> an instant grief ; ;
to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart .
`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , <UNK> <UNK> .
`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' .
She gave Jim a quick , <UNK> look of warning .
`` <UNK> take every one of them '' .
Jim <UNK> , but he lifted <UNK> suitcase and said , in a <UNK> tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand .
And when you get back from <UNK> , Cathy will be here to play with you .
<UNK> '' ? ?
`` No '' , Susan said , <UNK> with her <UNK> <UNK> of dolls with a <UNK> effect .
And at this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little <UNK> sharing dolls -- but she could <UNK> with Susan ; ;
there ought to be a limit to sharing , too .
That was one more reason she didn't look forward to <UNK> visit , short or long ; ;
the last one had been a <UNK> war .
She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had .
`` Well '' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' .
When the car , with <UNK> hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust .
The day was brilliant around her -- <UNK> , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil <UNK> it .
She had let Jim go with a <UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> kiss .
She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that .
She turned and began to walk toward the house .
At the feeding station , the <UNK> group of <UNK> again <UNK> and <UNK> over the ground , but now , <UNK> among them , was a beautiful red <UNK> , radiant in its <UNK> <UNK> .
The handsome bird was solitary ; ;
its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest .
She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ;
the <UNK> female <UNK> took instant advantage of <UNK> without <UNK> .
Well , Lucy ? ?
She said to herself , <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> .
She had a day of things to do ; ;
among them , she had to prepare the guest room .
How long would it be occupied ? ?
She wondered , with a <UNK> feeling of <UNK> .
As long as the <UNK> Myra chose ? ?
For a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself .
It isn't only birds that <UNK> their children in other people's <UNK> .
In the <UNK> of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room .
There were new yellow <UNK> , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new <UNK> , lively with <UNK> <UNK> , and hanging from the ceiling was an <UNK> Mother <UNK> Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze .
A row of little <UNK> waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ;
since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed .
The closet was <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a <UNK> ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , <UNK> , watching the funeral guests with <UNK> eyes .
Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her .
Out in the hall , the upstairs phone <UNK> , and the small ghost vanished .
When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there .
`` <UNK> <UNK> calling '' , she said .
`` I just thought I'd let you know .
Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago .
I'd have <UNK> sooner but I've been busy '' .
`` I can imagine '' ! !
Susan was an active character ; ;
for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be <UNK> now , surrounded by her <UNK> of dolls .
Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ;
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her .
You could think yourself as grown up as <UNK> , yet the <UNK> voice still kept its <UNK> magic .
`` How was Cathy '' ? ?
`` <UNK> .
But Myra was the <UNK> widow I ever saw '' .
On her way to the airport , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself .
`` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' .
There was a <UNK> pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ? ?
`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' .
`` Well '' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> life .
<UNK> , Lucy stared at the <UNK> <UNK> ; ;
her mother was <UNK> ; ;
she was not usually given to mysterious <UNK> .
Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good ? ?
`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? ?
Once the soft , pretty <UNK> found the bright light she had always wanted ? ?
Suddenly , <UNK> , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? ?
Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do .
Just before Myra left -- She was saying <UNK> to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near '' .
She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them .
`` Cathy was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at <UNK> I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' '' .
<UNK> <UNK> , Lucy sat there .
Then she jumped to her feet , the <UNK> phone <UNK> <UNK> like a black snake .
`` <UNK> ! !
'' Then it was no <UNK> she had dreamed up ; ;
it was only too true .
Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks .
For a moment , anger <UNK> the <UNK> about her , and when she found her voice , anger <UNK> it .
`` That does it '' ! !
She said .
`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks .
Then , if Myra does nothing about <UNK> her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself '' ! !
Her hand <UNK> on the receiver .
`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' .
For Lucy , the day's nagging <UNK> had come to an abrupt end .
As she hung up , she saw through the <UNK> open window the <UNK> flying of the <UNK> wings , and heard their grotesque singing .
<UNK> Myra ! !
She's not going to get away with it .
Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path .
The child's thin legs were <UNK> .
She <UNK> along slowly , both hands clutching a tired <UNK> bear .
She was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her <UNK> and <UNK> house .
Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;
the worn <UNK> bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had .
Lucy <UNK> at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the <UNK> of <UNK> ; ;
they would have to buy things for her .
She opened the door .
<UNK> , the dog <UNK> on the sand .
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for <UNK> .
For eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before <UNK> Beach got <UNK> with tourists and beach balls and <UNK> <UNK> .
The <UNK> sand made <UNK> limp more pronounced .
They walked slowly past the <UNK> <UNK> -- eleven lemon , nine <UNK> , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` <UNK> '' sign <UNK> in the wind .
Now they were in friendly territory .
Nobody around .
Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> edge .
His rock was to the right of a <UNK> <UNK> , a big , brown , <UNK> rock <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .
Here he was enclosed and safe .
( If a <UNK> or a sea <UNK> came along , didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a <UNK> ? ?
)
Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe .
He was <UNK> controlling the waves .
He was a <UNK> of the <UNK> Table , `` Sir <UNK> the <UNK> '' , <UNK> evil spirits and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> .
( One good thing about a suit of <UNK> , his leg wouldn't show .
) He was the first <UNK> on the moon , chosen because of his small size and <UNK> nature .
He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a <UNK> chest , a man the weak and <UNK> would turn to .
<UNK> .
Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being <UNK> by not turning on the bathroom light ? ?
A dark bathroom can be pretty <UNK> , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : <UNK> , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad .
He hadn't intended to make the promise .
It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America .
Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ;
and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint .
It's all right .
Stop shaking '' .
He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the <UNK> of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar .
`` Let's talk about the beach .
Son .
While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ?
Look , I can put two fingers between the <UNK> in the back of your neck .
Dr. <UNK> says swimming would help your leg .
He says you're <UNK> more than you need to '' .
`` How does he know ? ?
Big dumb nut .
He never had <UNK> '' .
In the light from the <UNK> table his father looked so worried that the promise <UNK> out .
`` You just wait , Dad .
When you get back I'll <UNK> be swimming better than Victoria .
Wait and see , Dad '' .
Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head <UNK> , and could <UNK> any boy or girl on the beach .
He called her `` <UNK> '' .
She called him `` <UNK> -- that's why nobody plays with you , <UNK> <UNK> '' .
Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at <UNK> : `` Please , Lord <UNK> , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' .
`` She's got a nerve '' .
Quint said now to the clouds .
<UNK> began to <UNK> up and down his chest .
He felt strong as a giant .
He <UNK> his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .
He <UNK> his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming <UNK> .
`` <UNK> , <UNK> '' , <UNK> a sea <UNK> .
`` <UNK> , shut up '' , he said .
He stood on the rock , a <UNK> , <UNK> boy surrounded by the ocean .
The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the <UNK> waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , <UNK> between the rocks and the waves .
I can't go in .
I'm scared of the nightmare .
<UNK> , he put on his clothes .
And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water .
`` <UNK> it , big shot '' , a <UNK> voice yelled back .
She was holding on to his rock with one hand .
She smelled of <UNK> .
She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no <UNK> on the <UNK> .
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ?
He snapped .
`` This is my rock '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
She was sore as a boil .
`` Ever hear of <UNK> rights '' ? ?
`` Sure .
They started with the <UNK> Bill of eighteen '' --
`` <UNK> Big <UNK> , aren't you '' ? ?
`` I'm Mark Gordon <UNK> the Fifth .
They call me Quint '' .
`` Then why don't you stop <UNK> '' ? ?
`` I said Quint .
That's short for <UNK> .
<UNK> in Latin means '' --
`` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart <UNK> '' .
Her <UNK> sounded like cloth <UNK> .
`` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voice .
`` I don't smoke '' .
She was <UNK> .
`` Do you '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes '' .
Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum .
`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' .
`` If I was your <UNK> , I'd <UNK> your tail off '' .
`` My mother never <UNK> me .
I've got this leg brace '' .
She seemed so <UNK> that he was obliged to roll up his blue <UNK> so she could see his brace .
`` <UNK> '' , was what she said .
`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a <UNK> pole '' ? ?
`` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always .
Dr. <UNK> says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' .
She <UNK> a <UNK> of water into the air .
`` A <UNK> mighty handy .
<UNK> walking past , you want to stop him , <UNK> , <UNK> him around the neck with the <UNK> in your cane .
Or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is <UNK> , <UNK> your cane on the floor .
Hey , will you look at that '' ? ?
Maggie had shaken himself awake and was <UNK> the sand off his <UNK> <UNK> and his long <UNK> of a tail .
`` That's some dog .
What kind '' ? ?
`` Part <UNK> , part <UNK> <UNK> '' .
Quint <UNK> .
He always did when people asked .
`` Holy <UNK> , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly .
`` His real <UNK> <UNK> , only we call him Maggie because he has to take <UNK> .
He's <UNK> than he looks .
He's been sick lately .
Last Tuesday he went on a ham <UNK> '' .
`` A what '' ? ?
He would have told her , but Victoria was <UNK> .
That meant `` Mama wants you Quint .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
`` I <UNK> go .
Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes .
I come early in the morning '' .
`` So do I .
See you around , <UNK> <UNK> '' .
That was how they started being friends .
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .
<UNK> time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ;
it made her <UNK> .
Her name was <UNK> , and the strip of <UNK> around her neck was an <UNK> <UNK> the King gave her as a token of his <UNK> love .
`` You going to marry the King '' ? ?
`` No .
He's got a long beard and <UNK> his teeth with a fork .
My hair is what he's nuts about .
Naturally <UNK> hair runs in my family .
<UNK> , I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the <UNK> , ' What can one do ' '' ? ?
`` Which continent '' ? ?
`` <UNK> one , I been there '' .
Japan , she said , smelled <UNK> because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ;
then they <UNK> off the mold and made fish soup .
<UNK> .
<UNK> in <UNK> had <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> drove their <UNK> down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .
As for dancing -- holy <UNK> , he ought to see the <UNK> in <UNK> ; ;
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them .
`` <UNK> '' .
Quint <UNK> a <UNK> .
She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so .
<UNK> , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War ; ;
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ;
that he personally had an <UNK> of <UNK> and was currently reading the <UNK> to <UNK> volume of the <UNK> .
`` <UNK> are for <UNK> '' .
She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , <UNK> laugh he liked to hear .
Nobody ever appreciated his <UNK> as much as <UNK> .
( `` What did one <UNK> say to the other <UNK> ? ?
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .
And `` What time did the <UNK> go to the dentist ? ?
<UNK> '' .
) <UNK> by her <UNK> he <UNK> Maggie who was crazy about ham .
He described the ham <UNK> with pineapple and <UNK> , cooling on the porch .
He <UNK> up on the ham like Maggie , <UNK> it with soft , <UNK> teeth , then panting with <UNK> , <UNK> up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , <UNK> home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it .
That dog has to go '' .
`` Say , you're quite a <UNK> '' , <UNK> said <UNK> .
`` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ? ?
He hadn't .
But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .
`` Either that or a <UNK> '' .
`` Better make up your mind , son '' , <UNK> said .
`` You can't serve <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
Sometimes they argued .
She said <UNK> have no bones and <UNK> <UNK> backward .
His <UNK> agreed with <UNK> .
Next morning he tied a bunch of sea <UNK> with string and threw them across the <UNK> <UNK> to the rock where she was swimming around .
<UNK> , could she catch ! !
Like Willie Mays in the <UNK> .
`` Nobody gave me flowers before .
Thank you , Quint '' .
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain <UNK> <UNK> say <UNK> '' .
Sometimes they didn't talk at all .
He <UNK> on the rock while she <UNK> and <UNK> around .
Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared .
But Victoria began <UNK> just then and he went home , carrying <UNK> in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , <UNK> of <UNK> .
As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , <UNK> of time .
Wednesday morning it happened .
They were eating breakfast .
`` We <UNK> thee , Lord <UNK> , to bless this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby <UNK> <UNK> toast on her plastic <UNK> .
<UNK> old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement .
`` Your <UNK> in San Francisco '' , she told them .
`` He says he'll be here on the <UNK> plane .
Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ?
`` Yeah , keen '' .
A cave seemed to be opening in <UNK> stomach .
`` Children , we'll have to get organized .
The baby can have an early <UNK> .
Victoria , I want you to -- ''
Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared .
`` <UNK> up , we're late '' , he said , <UNK> with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the <UNK> waves sending off sheets of blue and <UNK> green .
The cave in his stomach hurt .
He had to go into the water .
He'd tell <UNK> about the nightmare .
It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .
What caused it , he didn't know .
The metal collar <UNK> his neck ? ?
<UNK> so much ? ?
The <UNK> weight on his chest ? ?
All of it together meant <UNK> .
The first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second .
When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car , the <UNK> his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an <UNK> golf at <UNK> , it seemed to mark the end of a long , <UNK> chapter in the social life of the community .
Linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath .
Not that Linda was <UNK> , not that she would do anything <UNK> or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would .
<UNK> Linda been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? ?
<UNK> John Cooper even more attractive at <UNK> than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ?
And wasn't John's wife , Edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ?
<UNK> John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ?
<UNK> it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ?
And romantic ? ?
Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the <UNK> .
It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his .
`` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , <UNK> Chandler said to Linda Stuart .
`` Poor John '' ! !
Linda accepted the <UNK> , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of <UNK> when she was by all odds the <UNK> and <UNK> young woman west of the <UNK> Mountains , and John was surely one of the <UNK> and <UNK> young men around Pittsburgh .
For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the <UNK> Club to the <UNK> admiration not only of the <UNK> line but even of her fellow <UNK> .
John had claimed her from the <UNK> line , a young man a year out of Dartmouth with <UNK> <UNK> still around his eyes .
You saw them always together those years .
You talked about <UNK> as an entity .
<UNK> were at <UNK> <UNK> last night ; ;
<UNK> drove to <UNK> in three and a half hours .
Then there was a spat over something , as there had been <UNK> <UNK> before ; ;
only this one didn't <UNK> .
You still said `` <UNK> '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or <UNK> .
It got worse instead of better .
First , it came out after Mr. <UNK> will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more .
And then there was <UNK> engagement to Bobbie Evans .
There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John .
He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did .
Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to <UNK> John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be <UNK> even to sentimental wishful <UNK> .
It wasn't even John and Edythe .
It was simply Poor John .
There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either .
<UNK> Chandler had been to school with her <UNK> near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at <UNK> .
`` Well , you shouldn't <UNK> Edythe '' , <UNK> said .
`` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and <UNK> and <UNK> .
She is <UNK> and <UNK> , but she really isn't shallow '' .
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding .
John was at the church with Edythe .
She <UNK> during the ceremony , and <UNK> Chandler , who was one of <UNK> <UNK> , said John <UNK> black as death at her .
`` As if he were <UNK> '' , she said .
`` Poor John '' ! !
Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example .
Her hair never seemed to be in place and her <UNK> were never quite the correct length .
She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at <UNK> <UNK> , but her bathing suits were far from smart .
And you didn't see her much at <UNK> <UNK> or anywhere , for John had drifted away from the gang .
<UNK> said it was because he was too proud to stand pity .
Others thought he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything .
There were <UNK> reasons too .
John's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left .
John sold the big old place in <UNK> and bought a smaller house in <UNK> Chapel .
He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day .
John was good at his job .
It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the <UNK> with nothing but Edythe to come home to .
Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in 1938 , the <UNK> baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from <UNK> to pink toes , <UNK> a trace of Edythe .
But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made <UNK> <UNK> and general <UNK> more <UNK> .
She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda .
When there was bridge at <UNK> house , the cards <UNK> like wet <UNK> <UNK> and the food probably was wet <UNK> <UNK> .
She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. <UNK> , the <UNK> elder , who'd never <UNK> more than five dollars to anything , had to <UNK> up five hundred dollars to avoid a <UNK> in what Edythe called `` the <UNK> of the church '' .
John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually <UNK> , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries .
Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a <UNK> without <UNK> and maybe <UNK> over backward to keep a bad one .
He was an <UNK> and generous husband , <UNK> , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him .
But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ;
after the war back to the <UNK> <UNK> of the steel company .
The <UNK> saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary .
Bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money .
He and Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year .
And then came the <UNK> turn , the smashed <UNK> and Linda , <UNK> alone and lovely .
Everyone held his or her breath .
`` Don't think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , <UNK> Gordon , who had been <UNK> Chandler , said between <UNK> of a chicken <UNK> at a luncheon table at Le <UNK> .
`` Now you know she <UNK> , but she isn't that kind of girl .
But now -- well , it would be a blessing , I think .
Poor John '' .
Linda Evans felt more <UNK> than she had ever dreamed <UNK> death could move her to feeling .
What she felt was a <UNK> loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death .
She knew what people were thinking ; ;
it was what she had been thinking herself .
It was up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to <UNK> the wrong she had done , but she <UNK> at the decision as at the <UNK> of a cold stream .
There was no one who would blame her or John ; ;
she could be sure of that .
It might be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to <UNK> her , to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere .
And Linda felt capable of <UNK> the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own .
It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of .
Linda would have to wait , she knew .
But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ?
<UNK> of watching while Poor John <UNK> without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead .
Of course , he had done <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> and regular <UNK> had different sales departments at Smith & <UNK> , where John and Bobbie both worked .
Bobbie had been head of the <UNK> division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch .
So when old Mr. <UNK> , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular <UNK> had gone with <UNK> , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie .
For Linda knew how to help her husband , not just the <UNK> contacts but also the little dinners for <UNK> <UNK> .
She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job .
`` What did you do '' ? ?
She asked Bobbie .
`` You must have done something , something wrong .
Lord knows I had everything set for you '' .
Bobbie said something about damned <UNK> <UNK> together , and Linda got angry at him .
They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk .
Linda <UNK> her uncle , Donald <UNK> , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened .
He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision .
But <UNK> old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some <UNK> couldn't understand .
He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other .
`` I'm behind John Cooper '' , Mr. <UNK> said finally .
`` I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive .
`` Now , I believe Poor <UNK> work just a little harder .
With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance .
Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities .
And also , the money can't mean as much to Bobbie .
`` Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ;
Poor John will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights <UNK> about us '' .
Most of the directors nodded .
Uncle Donald <UNK> found himself <UNK> agreement too .
After the surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with <UNK> decision some months later to move to <UNK> <UNK> .
The job at <UNK> wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being <UNK> to John and assured him steady advancement , since <UNK> was owned to a large degree by various branches of <UNK> family .
Poor John's rise continued to be <UNK> .
When he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future .
She called then to say she had a <UNK> for that night .
`` <UNK> appreciated the chance to make some money .
Such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' .
`` That's <UNK> '' , I said <UNK> .
I could get along without that three dollars .
In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer <UNK> to Nadine ! !
It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang .
I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour .
I answered to find Nadine at the other end .
`` You scared me half to death '' , I said <UNK> .
`` What's wrong '' ? ?
`` <UNK> , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! !
Her voice came <UNK> .
`` I'm absolutely frantic ! !
That stupid girl might have gone off and left <UNK> '' ! !
`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said .
`` She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone .
But if you're worried you can go home and check '' --
`` I can't leave the party ! !
We're at Ken <UNK> apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! !
Old Mr. <UNK> is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' --
I was all set for what came next .
`` <UNK> , could you possibly go over and make sure <UNK> all right ? ?
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' --
`` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- <UNK> , as I said it , why I should make it at all .
Why should I go over at midnight to check on <UNK> , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ?
`` Fifteen minutes , then ! !
Please , <UNK> .
I'll be glad to pay you '' --
So sure that money could do anything ! !
`` All right '' , I said .
I'd do it .
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me .
But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? ?
Chris was sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him .
I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .
I drove off through the cool darkness to <UNK> apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door .
Her face was <UNK> from sleep .
`` It's all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared .
`` Mrs. Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you .
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
`` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she <UNK> .
She didn't look over thirteen .
And Nadine insisted that her <UNK> be reliable ! !
`` I have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on .
`` I didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! !
The phone started ringing .
`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said .
`` I'll answer it '' .
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home .
`` <UNK> , would you mind staying '' ? ?
There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying .
`` <UNK> drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want <UNK> to see him like this .
You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' --
Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done .
The receiver <UNK> in my ear .
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse .
Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! !
But then I looked at <UNK> and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk .
So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she <UNK> off to her own apartment .
After I looked in at <UNK> , I went into the living room and waited .
I must have <UNK> off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices .
<UNK> , <UNK> with anger -- <UNK> loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two .
I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him .
I had always thought she was so beautiful .
But now she looked ugly .
Her skin was stretched so tight that her <UNK> stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead .
`` <UNK> your clothes '' , she <UNK> .
`` <UNK> -- and get out '' ! !
`` You're crazy '' , Wally said <UNK> .
He <UNK> and stumbled to the <UNK> and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep .
Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails <UNK> across his face .
I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy .
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me .
`` He's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! !
He <UNK> Ken <UNK> '' ! !
Her eyes were wild .
`` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! !
And the other people there were listening ! !
We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' --
`` you'd better <UNK> down '' , I said <UNK> .
I was plenty scared .
In the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! !
`` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' --
`` <UNK> , '' Nadine <UNK> .
`` How can you be so damn stupid ? ?
<UNK> lost his job ! !
Ken will never forgive him -- never ! !
And we don't have any money -- we don't have a <UNK> ! !
All we own is <UNK> bedroom set and the <UNK> player and we even owe on them .
And we'll be poor and have to live in a <UNK> little house like yours -- and all because of that '' --
I <UNK> my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of <UNK> .
`` Stop that ! !
You'll wake up the whole building .
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' --
`` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain .
She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go <UNK> off anywhere at two in the morning .
`` You go to bed '' , I said <UNK> .
`` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' --
She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped .
I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had <UNK> herself out .
It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go .
I left her , a limp bundle of <UNK> , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her .
Wally was <UNK> on the <UNK> .
I had done all I could .
I had done all I was going to do .
Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine .
I drove home , found Chris still asleep .
I <UNK> up close to him -- loving him -- <UNK> for a man like him .
<UNK> I wasn't Nadine .
I kept on being <UNK> .
In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with <UNK> .
Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry .
`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much .
I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' --
Old Mr. <UNK> himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally <UNK> , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the <UNK> waiting to be repaired .
<UNK> that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .
Mr. <UNK> had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him .
`` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said <UNK> .
`` But Ken got <UNK> and wouldn't make any promises .
And I was <UNK> and I blew my <UNK> '' --
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! !
I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there .
But she was beyond caring what she said .
`` <UNK> may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern .
But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved .
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough .
When A bubble breaks , there's nothing .
Little by little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy <UNK> way Nadine and Wally had lived .
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their <UNK> , <UNK> on everything they owned .
On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were <UNK> .
<UNK> of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work .
He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was <UNK> .
Chris <UNK> .
`` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' .
I said I wished we were , too .
It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent .
But Chris <UNK> up like a candle .
`` I'm glad you feel that way , honey .
There is one big way we can help them .
We can let them move in with us '' --
Something I had simply never thought of .
Something so incredible --
I just stared at him .
It was incredible -- He gave me an <UNK> , pleading look .
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded .
But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' .
<UNK> out -- <UNK> had years of making all that money ! !
`` I won't do it '' , I said <UNK> .
`` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! !
Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! !
`` That isn't like you , <UNK> '' , Chris said <UNK> .
Then I felt uncomfortable , too .
I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter .
But , <UNK> it all , why should we help a couple of <UNK> <UNK> who had looked down their <UNK> at us ? ?
But , in the end , we did .
It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do .
The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name .
Then Wally got sick .
To my way of thinking , he was scared sick .
His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world .
Chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of <UNK> Nadine had bought on special .
At least we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away .
While I worked , Nadine sat and cried .
When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally .
`` <UNK> <UNK> nothing '' , she'd scream at him .
`` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job .
You're just a <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
It was a mess , all right .
But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said .
I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .
But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us .
<UNK> constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed .
He set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of <UNK> and <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> him .
Nobody would even take his application .
`` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap .
`` You can get a job working in a <UNK> store , if nothing else '' .
`` The high school kids have got everything <UNK> up '' , he said , a <UNK> in his voice .
`` Those damn <UNK> -- taking work away from men who need it '' .
`` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging .
But this was only the middle of July .
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this .
I mentioned it to Chris one <UNK> hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .
I don't really believe in intuition .
But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day .
Part of it was the weather , so <UNK> it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital .
Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late .
But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all .
It was just going to be one of those days .
For the <UNK> time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , <UNK> , <UNK> profession .
And for the <UNK> time , I answered myself .
I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me .
Actually , I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the <UNK> mirror .
I had a lot to be <UNK> for .
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be <UNK> at .
Maybe I didn't see as much of <UNK> as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an <UNK> or a <UNK> .
At least , we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be <UNK> of <UNK> than Mrs. Hodges was .
I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it .
<UNK> in the way <UNK> had turned out .
<UNK> up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been .
But I <UNK> start on Alice .
She is a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at .
If she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told <UNK> would probably have been true by now , anyhow
As usual , <UNK> bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .
Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me .
It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too .
Oh , I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision .
I had a feeling that young Pete <UNK> , the most promising <UNK> at <UNK> , had something to do with it , too .
She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay <UNK> about their date <UNK> my mood a little .
But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the <UNK> returned .
If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking .
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ?
Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from <UNK> all these years ? ?
The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to <UNK> .
Two <UNK> and Dick <UNK> , the other resident .
I'm Chief of <UNK> here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds .
Pete was down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there .
There wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one <UNK> than they should have been .
Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of <UNK> shock , but it was all taken care of now .
Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then .
When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor .
`` Got a new one in last night '' , he said .
`` I haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a <UNK> '' ! !
I wasn't surprised .
The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female <UNK> .
We didn't get many at <UNK> and they were never pretty sights .
It was thought <UNK> to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular <UNK> ward .
The moment I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed .
<UNK> cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk .
But there was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name .
Alice But this woman's name was Rose <UNK> ! !
I looked at the chart for <UNK> .
Yes , Rose <UNK> , diagnosis : acute <UNK> .
She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as <UNK> .
An ugly scar <UNK> the somewhat familiar <UNK> face , already <UNK> by the <UNK> network of broken red <UNK> that heavy <UNK> carry .
Her coarse hair was <UNK> -- <UNK> blonde and its real , dirty gray .
Oh , could it be ? ?
No , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and I turned to Dick , forcing myself to put my <UNK> out of my mind .
In a low voice , Dick filled us in
she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway .
Although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out .
It was the old story .
We'd keep her a day or two , and the <UNK> people would talk to her .
But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left .
Turning toward the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick .
I tell you , it took every <UNK> of control I had to be able to speak .
`` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. <UNK> '' ? ?
I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it <UNK> them , I've always thought , to <UNK> first .
This was one time I'd have <UNK> broken my own rule , but habit was too strong .
`` Hey '' ! !
Her voice was flat and dull .
But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away .
It was then that I saw what the <UNK> covers revealed .
There were <UNK> on the sheet .
`` What's this '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Your period '' ? ?
She shook her head .
`` I been <UNK> a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice .
`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ?
Once again , there was a negative shake .
I told Miss <UNK> to move her down the hall where we had an <UNK> table .
`` Better do a <UNK> '' , I told Pete .
It was only a few moments before Miss <UNK> had her in the proper position for a <UNK> , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination .
Pete stood by with a slide and took the <UNK> , sent it down to the <UNK> with a request for the test .
That done , I told Miss <UNK> to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind .
I was busy the rest of the day .
<UNK> in the afternoon , I was up on Seven again .
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled .
On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete .
`` I've got the results on the <UNK> <UNK> test '' , he said .
`` There's something there , all right .
Class Three , they said .
Do you want to talk to her , Doctor '' ? ?
`` Well '' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again .
But that was ridiculous , of course .
`` All right .
We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a <UNK> .
Maybe it's nothing , maybe it's <UNK> or in <UNK> -- can't take any chances '' .
`` If you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said <UNK> .
`` <UNK> tells me she's started <UNK> already , wants to get out .
<UNK> to get to her <UNK> , I guess '' .
I <UNK> in <UNK> .
`` Well , better see what I can do '' .
We'd been standing right outside Miss <UNK> door and as I went to turn the <UNK> to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly <UNK> .
But she seemed to be <UNK> and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones .
Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward <UNK> .
`` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said .
`` I just got through seeing one of you guys .
What do you want '' ? ?
There was something almost <UNK> in her tone , but I <UNK> it .
`` I've just been talking to Dr. <UNK> '' , I said .
`` We'd like you to have a <UNK> and <UNK> .
That's quite minor , nothing to worry about .
But we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary '' .
`` No '' .
It was flat , definite .
`` Suppose you let me explain .
Actually , I rather doubt that we'll have to do this .
Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' .
I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor .
`` No '' .
I looked at her in amazement .
I'd had patients who'd refused <UNK> before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why .
<UNK> , it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the <UNK> .
`` Will you tell me why '' ? ?
I asked .
She smiled , a smile without humor .
`` You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said .
`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?
She went on , <UNK> my protests .
`` I'm not going to be one of your <UNK> <UNK> .
Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor .
Just let me die in peace '' .
I stared at her , almost <UNK> .
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was .
Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone .
This was someone who'd come down in the world , I thought .
A long , long way down .
Again there was something familiar about her , something --
`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could .
`` I don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? ?
And even if '' --
`` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe '' .
I <UNK> at her .
She could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult .
But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke .
She was watching me <UNK> , a funny little <UNK> on her lips .
`` <UNK> , baby ? ?
<UNK> I've changed , haven't I ? ?
But you haven't changed much , Joe '' .
I knew then , knew with a <UNK> shock .
`` Alice '' -- I <UNK> through dry lips .
`` Alice , for goodness sake '' --
`` Alice '' , she <UNK> <UNK> .
`` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of me ? ?
<UNK> I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ?
Well , don't worry .
Just let me <UNK> here '' --
`` But why did you come back '' ? ?
I'd found my voice .
`` Where have you been all these years '' ? ?
She shrugged .
`` Here and there .
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to .
The last thing I remember is a bar in San <UNK> '' --
The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her <UNK> <UNK> , made me <UNK> .
And this was <UNK> mother ! !
`` I never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now .
Let me <UNK> here ! !
You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ?
No , I want out , Joe '' ! !
I looked at the <UNK> <UNK> of a woman before me .
Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ?
What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me .
If I let her go , she'd disappear once more .
And <UNK> would be safe ! !
I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .
She made me welcome .
Her dark cool <UNK> were <UNK> than any woman's ; ;
the many little <UNK> she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen <UNK> .
<UNK> , she <UNK> me , and drew me deeper into her .
I no longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under <UNK> feet , getting <UNK> , happier and more <UNK> by the second .
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now .
Only the dive itself had any meaning .
The <UNK> nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the <UNK> and <UNK> in the sweet water .
Perhaps if I took off the <UNK> I could swim better , love my woman better .
I chuckled aloud , and the <UNK> fell out .
While a <UNK> part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part <UNK> over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time .
It was when I packed up what <UNK> I had and went to Paris .
It was no vacation , just me getting out after a <UNK> .
I knew it wouldn't be the same .
<UNK> <UNK> never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind .
Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married <UNK> .
That first time was good and it stuck with me .
I was <UNK> back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at <UNK> instead of <UNK> .
It was a Saturday evening in April with a <UNK> rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life .
I had a <UNK> of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be <UNK> all night .
In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel , <UNK> , shaved and was out on the <UNK> <UNK> in a fresh uniform .
I felt like a <UNK> in Rome .
All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ;
everything was <UNK> to my <UNK> eyes .
There were some sweet machines other than women : an old <UNK> , a lean <UNK> <UNK> on an American <UNK> , a <UNK> , a type <UNK> <UNK> and lots more .
There was the <UNK> de <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> -- I was no <UNK> , but I was young , and this was Paris ! !
I had champagne at <UNK> , then went into a cafe called the <UNK> et <UNK> to ask the way to <UNK> .
I never got there .
I met Claire , which was better .
She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine .
I stared .
I didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful .
She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress .
Maybe her <UNK> eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it .
When she had <UNK> the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said :
`` <UNK> soldier , I have <UNK> one hunger with food .
I feel another of terrible urgency .
Is your evening free '' ? ?
`` Madame '' , I said with <UNK> <UNK> because of the `` handsome '' -- `` <UNK> '' .
And so off we went to her apartment .
She was a <UNK> , of course , the poor girl .
<UNK> the break of day I <UNK> philosophical , and drew <UNK> about her way of eating bread and cheese .
Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned .
I got there on a Saturday evening .
I made the mistake of going to the <UNK> et <UNK> .
The place was busy but I didn't feel like a <UNK> .
I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up .
I had part of a bottle of French beer called <UNK> <UNK> ( so help me ) , then switched to <UNK> .
After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was <UNK> .
I went to my hotel and slept .
The next morning a little <UNK> made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ?
So I drank more <UNK> .
All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .
I read the <UNK> of <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> .
<UNK> , but sex .
That's what was on my mind .
I was turning over the idea of a good <UNK> when I <UNK> off .
I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up .
My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was <UNK> to this Paris idea as a <UNK> on top of all my others .
A good <UNK> has that kind of therapeutic value .
<UNK> earlier the weather had turned cold and it was <UNK> .
I went out into it .
I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a <UNK> bench where the light was dim and came from the sky .
There was dignity and beauty in the little white <UNK> falling through the blue night .
I had on only a <UNK> , but I wasn't cold .
I was just miserable .
<UNK> soon a woman came along carrying a folded <UNK> as a walking stick .
She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away .
Suddenly I understood why she had the <UNK> .
It gave her <UNK> and posture .
Without it she would have been <UNK> and limp .
It gave her <UNK> .
It gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle .
I couldn't imagine her without it .
I knew all about her .
She was another human being and happened to be a <UNK> .
I didn't much care if she were there or not .
After a while she said with sort of an <UNK> laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears '' .
( I didn't have on a hat .
)
<UNK> <UNK> at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone .
She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ?
`` I'm not unhappy '' , I <UNK> , staring at the snow .
She was trying to make a hole in my <UNK> , and I didn't want it .
`` Is it a woman '' ? ?
She asked gently .
She must have seen the ring on my left hand .
`` Well -- women and <UNK> go together '' , I observed <UNK> , adding , `` You can <UNK> your <UNK> on that '' .
`` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to <UNK> it .
''
This took me so funny I had to look at her .
I felt my frozen sad face <UNK> , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped .
I even <UNK> a <UNK> .
She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile .
She was even more miserable than me .
Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was <UNK> and infinite wisdom in them .
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ?
She asked .
Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ?
I could see the ancient <UNK> reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same <UNK> .
Anyway , I pulled a bottle of <UNK> Martin out of my <UNK> , drew the cork , and passed it to her .
I could see she was shocked .
`` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said .
`` <UNK> , non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' .
She tilted up and drank , and then I drank .
It's really <UNK> to drink good <UNK> like that , but I hadn't cared before .
I wasn't going to <UNK> around a glass .
There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well .
No child , this <UNK> , she must have been thirty-five or even forty .
I couldn't be sure .
Somehow she was attractive .
Not good looking , but <UNK> and wise so that it made her attractive .
I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there .
We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .
I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it .
We seemed to be <UNK> , sadly , <UNK> , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell .
Then she said , `` <UNK> '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word .
I sensed no stranger in her .
We <UNK> and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with <UNK> .
I decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age .
She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side .
I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the <UNK> had melted .
I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's <UNK> .
My head was clear .
I was hungry as a <UNK> , and my body felt lean and vital .
`` <UNK> <UNK> '' , I said <UNK> , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her <UNK> .
She looked good , with her short <UNK> hair and no <UNK> .
Maybe closer to thirty , I thought .
`` <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
She exclaimed , smiling .
`` <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' .
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .
I called downstairs for food and a <UNK> for her .
She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my <UNK> .
I had brushed my teeth , <UNK> , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast .
`` The <UNK> Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it .
I gave it to the woman .
`` What is this for '' ? ?
She asked <UNK> .
`` Why , to brush your teeth '' .
`` But I already have ! !
I used yours '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
I said with round eyes .
I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself .
But I smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live <UNK> , I decided I would <UNK> my worries away .
The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good .
We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot <UNK> eggs and hot <UNK> bread .
As we ate , we talked .
Her name was <UNK> , and mine Stephen .
We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee .
`` You are very <UNK> , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked .
`` <UNK> '' ? ?
I grunted , <UNK> .
`` Yes , because you didn't run off to use that new <UNK> '' .
I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .
`` I didn't really use yours '' , she went on .
`` I carry one in my purse .
I know men never kiss <UNK> <UNK> '' .
To my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the <UNK> today '' ? ?
`` All right '' .
I said with enthusiasm at the idea .
`` But not immediately '' .
I put aside my empty cup .
She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and <UNK> her own .
We were not rushed .
`` What is this from '' ? ?
I asked , touching the scar on her stomach .
It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle .
`` A bullet '' , she answered .
The <UNK> was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all .
She understood sex anyway , and played at it well .
We went to the <UNK> for a few hours , then by <UNK> to a <UNK> in <UNK> .
It was a nice place , not filled with smoke .
We had champagne and <UNK> <UNK> .
The <UNK> brought the wine first , a <UNK> instead of the bottle I had ordered .
He must have thought I was a tourist .
I fixed him with a <UNK> eye and said , `` What's this for ? ?
I didn't ask for a <UNK> of champagne '' .
I thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh .
Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa <UNK> : she put them in her bag .
She would not stop to read them in American <UNK> , as many were doing , sitting on <UNK> or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street .
This was her first day in Rome and it was June .
An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead .
In her <UNK> eye -- her imagination <UNK> fully , almost <UNK> , to these <UNK> peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , <UNK> on its great bare <UNK> that the <UNK> marked , <UNK> and <UNK> , here a <UNK> , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills .
<UNK> in old Latin books returned to her : the <UNK> Way Today , the <UNK> , the <UNK> of <UNK> .
She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight .
Moreover , nursing various <UNK> -- her <UNK> , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy <UNK> ( everybody could tell you the <UNK> were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot .
England , France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of <UNK> and <UNK> , she had conceived a <UNK> passion by <UNK> , to see all these places with her own eyes .
The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go .
There's nothing to stop me now .
So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly <UNK> .
In the street the traffic was really frightening .
<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> all went <UNK> at once down the narrow length of it or <UNK> <UNK> around a fountain .
<UNK> of tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with <UNK> attached , <UNK> dressed Americans looking in shop windows .
<UNK> to be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left .
The Spanish <UNK> .
Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of <UNK> plants .
She had heard about it the night before at her hotel .
It was not yet complete : <UNK> were <UNK> the <UNK> plants from a truck and placing them in <UNK> rows on the steps above .
The <UNK> were as large as <UNK> , and their <UNK> <UNK> , many still tight in the <UNK> , ranged in color from purple through <UNK> and rose to the <UNK> pink , along with many white ones too .
<UNK> , thought Theresa , climbing in her <UNK> , <UNK> way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything .
In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed .
<UNK> up the staircase she stopped and sat down .
Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide <UNK> and leaning over the <UNK> above , watching the <UNK> mass , or just enjoying the sun .
Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing <UNK> air .
The sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the <UNK> of stones or the chill <UNK> of churches .
She <UNK> her <UNK> jacket and smoked a cigarette .
<UNK> excited ; ;
how could you be both at once ? ?
<UNK> , but she was .
Presently , she picked up the first of the letters .
A few moments later her hands were trembling and her <UNK> had <UNK> with anxiety and <UNK> .
Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! !
Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to <UNK> in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? ?
And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ?
She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her .
Her Cousin Emma <UNK> had written it , in her loose high old <UNK> script -- <UNK> carefully crossed , but <UNK> inclined to <UNK> like an old car on the downward slope .
Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa <UNK> , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in <UNK> , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her <UNK> neighbor .
No return address <UNK> .
Somebody had <UNK> American <UNK> , Piazza <UNK> <UNK> ? ?
, across the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope .
Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander <UNK> .
Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- <UNK> , devoted , <UNK> -- had lived next door to the <UNK> in <UNK> from time <UNK> until the <UNK> had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago .
Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out <UNK> about what too much rain might do to his <UNK> , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top <UNK> of his secretary a <UNK> paper knife which Theresa had <UNK> as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died .
I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh .
This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it .
She <UNK> the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George .
But <UNK> George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to <UNK> to Cousin <UNK> funeral .
He was full of heavy family <UNK> .
All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today .
His own children had suffered from the <UNK> of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his <UNK> ( he had one so far , still in <UNK> ) , he <UNK> to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all .
A life of <UNK> and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand .
Poor George ! !
The only boy , the family darling .
<UNK> with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong .
Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right <UNK> , and though pursued by various girls and various <UNK> of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George .
Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ?
As for Cousin Alexander <UNK> , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had <UNK> long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole <UNK> family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin <UNK> call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George .
There they all did their <UNK> to help Cousin Elec get a <UNK> out of his foot .
He had <UNK> downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his <UNK> , on a <UNK> .
He held his long <UNK> foot in both hands , and this and his <UNK> face -- he was trying <UNK> not to cry out -- made him look like a large <UNK> old monkey .
They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have <UNK> , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a <UNK> of hot water which she poured <UNK> into a white <UNK> pan .
`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
She kept <UNK> .
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
`` You might treat it like the <UNK> '' , said Papa .
`` <UNK> a cold key down his back '' .
`` I just hope this happens to you <UNK> '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best .
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said .
He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not <UNK> .
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .
Now , here they both were , still the same , George full of <UNK> <UNK> , and Cousin Emma in despair .
Theresa shifted to a new page .
`` Of course ( <UNK> letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered .
Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to <UNK> from it .
<UNK> and <UNK> tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an <UNK> , especially as long as our <UNK> is still in high school .
The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that <UNK> is populated with -- Miss <UNK> <UNK> , for example .
But there is more in this than meets the eye .
A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in .
The <UNK> in the back bedroom is literally <UNK> off .
'' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house .
) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .
I may settle on some <UNK> arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best .
''
I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick .
I'll start <UNK> in a minute , sitting on these cold steps .
She got up , standing <UNK> for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men .
They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow <UNK> , and their hair looked <UNK> black and <UNK> .
Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so .
Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap <UNK> , Parker fountain <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> .
`` No '' , said Theresa .
`` No , no '' ! !
She said .
The man did not wish to leave .
He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them .
<UNK> rides in the park , the <UNK> by moonlight , he specialized .
Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two .
There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of <UNK> , while the <UNK> picked himself another <UNK> American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome <UNK> bag , <UNK> the steps alone .
Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered .
The lady with the <UNK> bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ;
at last , alarm .
She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! !
Finally , she <UNK> away up the steps .
Theresa <UNK> , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an <UNK> between Cousin <UNK> death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma .
They were even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very <UNK> in not <UNK> that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin <UNK> house ready before the teachers came to <UNK> in September .
Of course , it wasn't Anne and <UNK> fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always <UNK> that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa ? ?
The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter <UNK> , nothing here is supposed even to exist .
They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow .
It never registered with them that I had time to read all of <UNK> , Dickens , and <UNK> while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after <UNK> operation .
It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all <UNK> volumes of <UNK> <UNK> .
She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other .
Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two .
`` <UNK> '' ? ?
She became aware that two Italian <UNK> , carrying a large <UNK> pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display .
`` <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> .
''
`` Oh put it there '' ! !
She indicated a spot a little distance away .
I knew it as surely as everybody in <UNK> -- that Lucille was a husband <UNK> .
You can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only <UNK> .
And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren .
Just as it has its Susan <UNK> , though <UNK> ever bothered to tell me that .
Susan <UNK> , that's me .
They even talked about Lucille down at the Young <UNK> League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission .
I never heard my folks talk about her , though .
They were <UNK> religious people , and I can <UNK> say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody .
Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me .
My folks and my faith protected me from things like that .
And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren .
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
I asked him if it was true .
He gave me a straight , honest answer .
`` Look , <UNK> baby '' , he'd said .
Much as I love you -- well , a <UNK> a guy and <UNK> willing to -- to come across .
<UNK> , <UNK> , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' .
