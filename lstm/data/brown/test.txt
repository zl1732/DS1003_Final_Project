I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren .
But it didn't seem fair .
My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex .
Johnnie was a <UNK> with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the <UNK> line .
It was a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered .
I wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different .
He wasn't only different -- he was it .
He had an easy <UNK> grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men .
His smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp .
The most <UNK> thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too .
I could hardly believe such good luck was mine .
And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him .
I guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie .
I didn't like it one bit .
But what could I do ? ?
A man had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie .
Neither was his wife .
She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her .
But he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will .
And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that .
He was too honorable to leave his wife <UNK> and leave those helpless children without their <UNK> .
Johnnie loved me and wanted me .
But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind .
It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time .
Against my <UNK> wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck .
The rides were <UNK> enough -- mostly we talked .
But by the time the first <UNK> of spring came around , we both knew we were <UNK> in love .
Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little .
`` It's so crazy '' , I told him once .
`` I always imagined I would probably end up <UNK> a minister or somebody like that .
Somebody with no <UNK> .
You know '' .
`` And you fall for a lumber <UNK> '' .
`` Who drinks far too much '' .
`` And <UNK> too much '' .
`` And '' , I was <UNK> off the items on my fingers , `` <UNK> too much and goes out with the boys , <UNK> they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the <UNK> '' .
He examined his nails carefully .
`` I could walk out the door '' .
`` Don't you dare '' .
`` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' .
He still wasn't looking at me .
`` You wouldn't '' .
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .
`` You wouldn't .
Please ! !
You wouldn't '' .
He shrugged <UNK> .
`` I might '' .
And now he was seeing her .
He'd just admitted it to me .
I huddled <UNK> beside him in the truck .
It was all my doing -- his seeing her .
Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it .
At first , Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ?
But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' .
But what had I done , trying to keep us pure ? ?
I had driven him into the arms of that <UNK> woman .
I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the <UNK> ! !
So one week later , I <UNK> to him in the little motel on Route 10 .
My very first time .
I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the <UNK> of Lucille Warren .
And , though at the time I <UNK> to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever <UNK> .
I wanted him , with a <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me .
`` Love me , Johnnie '' .
`` I will , <UNK> '' ! !
Outside , in the <UNK> fields behind the motel , a thousand <UNK> <UNK> us .
`` Will you always love me this way '' ? ?
`` <UNK> <UNK> .
Always '' .
`` <UNK> '' .
And I <UNK> closer to the man I loved .
It was as <UNK> and <UNK> a night as any bride ever experienced .
I had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no <UNK> of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them .
`` Johnnie ? ?
`` It can't be wrong , can it ? ?
Not really '' .
Johnnie rose on one <UNK> .
`` Stop <UNK> .
It's never wrong if love is real '' .
I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness .
<UNK> peace , complete <UNK> .
<UNK> delight , I later discovered .
I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious <UNK> .
I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about .
I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married .
I was practically a bride , after all .
There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible .
Of this , I had no doubt .
<UNK> Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ?
Of course he would .
He'd not only told me so , he'd proved it .
It wasn't <UNK> fault that he was <UNK> tied down to that <UNK> woman who did her best to make his life <UNK> .
Just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too .
And if I could contribute to that , I'd do it .
The cost didn't matter .
No price is too high when true love is at stake .
And I had no doubts about how true this love was .
I'd never even <UNK> with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the <UNK> while , not until I all but threw myself at him .
He was plenty <UNK> , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .
What could a mere twelve years matter ? ?
It wasn't , I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity .
And hadn't I <UNK> him from Lucille Warren ? ?
She'd have gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her .
After all , Lucille Warren was a <UNK> from way back .
But I'd been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the <UNK> love we shared .
It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring .
`` Love me '' ? ?
`` <UNK> .
Love you '' .
`` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? ?
`` Always '' .
`` <UNK> '' .
<UNK> time in Boston .
A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow .
From the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young <UNK> League , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter .
I had mixed emotions about going .
I'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days .
But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group .
I hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in <UNK> and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever .
I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group .
So I went to Boston .
The first meeting was held in <UNK> Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states .
My cousin <UNK> , at whose home I was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island .
One of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named <UNK> , a boy about my age with <UNK> , blond hair and dancing blue eyes .
He looked very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me .
I thought so , and he mentioned it , and <UNK> said so too .
After the meeting , there was going to be a party at <UNK> house .
I assumed <UNK> would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated .
Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my <UNK> .
`` Hey , there , beautiful <UNK> of mine '' , <UNK> said .
`` <UNK> a <UNK> to get to the party '' ? ?
I couldn't help laughing with him .
`` Well , I should find <UNK> '' -- I began .
`` <UNK> , <UNK> .
Come along with me '' .
I went .
By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong .
A couple of the girls were laughing rather <UNK> and I realized they were drinking .
My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie .
I hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning .
But when Johnnie disguised the taste with <UNK> <UNK> , I enjoyed it .
Of course I enjoyed <UNK> anything if I did it with Johnnie .
Johnnie I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening .
But that was only natural , I decided ; ;
surely he was still resting <UNK> in my heart .
`` I don't see <UNK> anywhere '' , I said .
`` She's <UNK> tonight .
<UNK> , let's find out where they're keeping the glasses '' .
I drew back .
`` I -- I don't think so , <UNK> .
Not for me '' .
`` <UNK> , come on '' .
`` No -- really '' .
He shrugged .
`` Okay .
But at least come along while I get <UNK> '' .
The kitchen was <UNK> .
<UNK> faces , most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting .
Under normal circumstances , he had a certain <UNK> <UNK> charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs .
Today , he looked like an <UNK> who had left his <UNK> <UNK> on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach .
<UNK> , he thought .
A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better .
He looked around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , <UNK> stove .
Then he remembered .
`` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in <UNK> rain , that had sounded reasonable .
In the cold light of day , it seemed a <UNK> arrangement .
<UNK> bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ?
She had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units .
And where was the thing ? ?
He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of <UNK> <UNK> .
Ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` <UNK> <UNK> '' between Unit <UNK> Three and Unit <UNK> Four .
It was still <UNK> , and Mrs. <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through the gray <UNK> like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and <UNK> .
Charlie <UNK> his orange juice and one of the long , <UNK> green <UNK> , his spirits as damp as the day .
This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it .
`` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said .
`` <UNK> of sun , lots of rest .
The red <UNK> are a <UNK> compound .
This is a sleeping <UNK> .
The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked .
You young men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly '' .
Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment .
The doctor could call it anything from flu to <UNK> ; ;
but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it .
He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by <UNK> the bride <UNK> forever , which was really <UNK> it on .
He had caught , too , like an <UNK> , a confirmed <UNK> of women .
Once burned -- <UNK> , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy .
From now on , his was going to be a man's world : the North <UNK> , duck <UNK> at <UNK> , beer and <UNK> and male <UNK> .
Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make <UNK> <UNK> at his feet , the doctor's <UNK> for lots of sun seemed like a hollow <UNK> .
In these damp circumstances , he was an <UNK> bet to develop <UNK> .
He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , bearing down on him .
`` <UNK> blow '' ! !
She <UNK> <UNK> .
He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really <UNK> weather as a kind of <UNK> victory over the tourists .
`` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added .
`` I hope so '' , he said .
`` I've got this cold .
<UNK> I'd <UNK> it out in the sun '' .
`` Ah '' .
She studied him briefly .
`` You've got a <UNK> look .
Better get in out of the wet '' .
Charlie <UNK> to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , <UNK> being less than <UNK> .
As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever .
He could imagine her at this minute , <UNK> in Nassau with <UNK> , <UNK> on golden <UNK> , looking forward to a life of <UNK> <UNK> .
All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a <UNK> <UNK> for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long .
He <UNK> through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the <UNK> <UNK> ( At the <UNK> , At the Mountains , On the Farm , and In <UNK> ) and several agricultural <UNK> on the treatment of <UNK> disease in cattle , <UNK> illustrated .
He <UNK> , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , <UNK> his other <UNK> .
He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the <UNK> , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and <UNK> .
His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her <UNK> for color , had <UNK> a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ;
but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the <UNK> variety that <UNK> onto men's <UNK> -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size <UNK> .
He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the <UNK> , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind .
Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .
`` Would you mind <UNK> your onion '' ? ?
Said this note .
`` The smell <UNK> everything '' ! !
Everything being the sweater , a <UNK> case , and a <UNK> bottle of <UNK> <UNK> pink hand lotion .
The note paper was pink , too , and the <UNK> small and <UNK> and utterly feminine .
Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach <UNK> .
He <UNK> `` <UNK> '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat '' ? ?
He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ;
but on the other hand , he didn't want her <UNK> his <UNK> .
`` Not <UNK> '' , came the answer the following day .
`` <UNK> '' .
Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered <UNK> just why she kept the sweater <UNK> .
But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense .
Take Vivian .
Yes , take Vivian .
Somebody had .
Now , if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink .
They would be black or white or <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> , like Vivian herself .
<UNK> , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and <UNK> girls who wore pink were <UNK> <UNK> to their infancy .
`` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? ?
He <UNK> aloud .
<UNK> '' ? ?
It was Mrs. Kirby , making her <UNK> way along the <UNK> , <UNK> with a <UNK> collection of <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> .
`` What's that you say '' ? ?
`` Oh , nothing .
Just glad the <UNK> stopped '' .
`` Oh , yes .
Just look at that sky .
Be a <UNK> by afternoon '' .
`` I hope so .
I've got this cold '' .
`` So you said '' .
She <UNK> him .
`` My , you're <UNK> .
You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an <UNK> , first sunny day .
I must remember to warn the girl next to you in <UNK> .
That pale <UNK> the worst '' .
That pale kind , Charlie thought .
<UNK> an <UNK> description .
But then , neither was <UNK> .
He could hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against <UNK> .
`` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say .
`` He's that <UNK> kind '' .
<UNK> there was a better word .
Charlie looked in the mirror .
<UNK> , <UNK> .
He looked more closely .
<UNK> , <UNK> -- <UNK> .
Clearly , two damp days with the <UNK> <UNK> had done him no good .
The sun , <UNK> hot as <UNK> , was far from kind to Mrs. <UNK> <UNK> properties .
When Charlie came up from the beach for his <UNK> pill , the whole establishment ( <UNK> enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a <UNK> modern painting -- great blocks of <UNK> color , <UNK> at regular intervals by the <UNK> white of five community <UNK> .
This weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more <UNK> retreat , with Cape <UNK> , maybe , at the door .
He could not imagine a <UNK> being brave enough to grow beside <UNK> , <UNK> , and the rest .
The sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes .
No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes .
He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his <UNK> to her side of the refrigerator and <UNK> `` Be my guest '' on the <UNK> .
It gave him a good feeling .
`` <UNK> .
Thanks '' , was her answer the next day .
The note was <UNK> against his pill bottles and bore a <UNK> : `` You're not at all well , are you '' ? ?
`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote .
Not that it was any of her business .
`` It's none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt <UNK> used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be <UNK> .
I mean , she's still living , and she's <UNK> .
Why don't you try that '' ? ?
`` I don't have a lemon '' .
He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the <UNK> of paper .
By the next morning , she had turned the paper over .
`` <UNK> , neither do I '' .
Charlie grinned .
She didn't sound like a pale girl .
She sounded a little like a <UNK> .
But then , <UNK> are often pale .
He stuck his head in Mrs. <UNK> little rental office .
`` I guess that <UNK> next to me took your advice .
I haven't seen her on the beach '' .
`` You won't , if you're looking for a <UNK> .
She's got <UNK> hair '' .
He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , <UNK> girl in a pink bathing suit .
There were pink bathing suits on <UNK> , and <UNK> girls in red or black or green bathing suits .
There were a <UNK> of daring <UNK> and a <UNK> of <UNK> tank suits .
Up on a <UNK> , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an <UNK> and absorbed in her painting .
He paid little attention to her because she was a <UNK> and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , <UNK> <UNK> .
On the beach , there were pale girls and <UNK> girls .
And he saw them all as he walked up and down .
At two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down <UNK> , up and down the <UNK> , up and down the silent , <UNK> beach .
Finally , in <UNK> , he opened the refrigerator , <UNK> her hand lotion , and left a note .
`` I've got this <UNK> '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion .
Hope you don't mind '' .
`` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered .
`` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ? ?
Use all the lotion you want , and for <UNK> sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' .
This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided .
<UNK> is a fine quality in a woman .
Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy .
She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ;
it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own .
He didn't know what was so tough about <UNK> world , <UNK> around Nassau with <UNK> .
Suppose <UNK> got a <UNK> ? ?
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .
She might <UNK> him , once the worst of the agony was over .
Charlie spent the next two days in his <UNK> <UNK> , waiting for the fire in his back to <UNK> , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion .
<UNK> passed back and forth .
`` How's your <UNK> now ? ?
The only thing , this lotion has <UNK> in it , and that <UNK> the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a <UNK> , you may not want to use it '' .
`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' .
`` That Mrs. Kirby ! !
I'll bet she told you I was <UNK> , too .
How's your cold '' ? ?
`` <UNK> out .
She didn't say you were <UNK> .
Are you ? ?
What's <UNK> '' ? ?
`` <UNK> goes with pale and <UNK> .
Do you have anything to read while you're shut up ? ?
There are two things here about <UNK> in the <UNK> , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His <UNK> <UNK> ' ; ;
but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister .
Also the <UNK> '' .
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .
The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an <UNK> fast ball that took a <UNK> .
For a few <UNK> the Anniston team couldn't figure him out .
Then , in the fifth , <UNK> kid catcher caught onto a curve and <UNK> the ball into left center field .
Eddie Lee , <UNK> <UNK> playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him .
Phil <UNK> cut over to center from left field to get the <UNK> .
Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .
`` Third ! !
Third base '' ! !
Eddie shouted .
Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike <UNK> hands on third base .
Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .
But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late .
He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face .
`` You bastard '' ! !
The Anniston catcher screamed .
He jumped to his feet and started to throw <UNK> .
Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .
This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the <UNK> .
The fighters were separated in a few minutes .
The game was resumed .
But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .
When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the <UNK> .
Phil <UNK> , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink .
Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field .
He was <UNK> the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .
`` Keep your eyes open , <UNK> '' ! !
Mike yelled to the catcher .
`` You're in for trouble '' .
The Anniston catcher did not reply with words .
He simply turned to Mike and smiled .
This so <UNK> Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard .
So help me God , I'll get him '' .
Phil <UNK> said : `` Why don't you leave him alone '' ? ?
`` <UNK> your own <UNK> business '' , Mike Deegan said .
Phil shrugged .
He stepped into the <UNK> , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble .
Maybe the answer was in his eyes .
When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .
In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left <UNK> head .
By the time the <UNK> got his hands on the ball Deegan was <UNK> third base and heading for home .
The left <UNK> threw and it was a good one .
But Mike had no chance of being <UNK> .
The Anniston catcher was <UNK> home plate .
All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he <UNK> into the catcher .
Both fell heavily to the ground .
Only Mike got to his feet .
He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the <UNK> without looking back .
The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field .
They poured water over their <UNK> face .
He did not move .
Then the manager called for a doctor .
The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured <UNK> .
Then , quickly , and a little <UNK> , the doctor ordered a couple of <UNK> to carry the catcher into the dressing room .
Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching .
When the <UNK> started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the <UNK> '' .
Phil <UNK> , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .
The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside <UNK> .
He was followed by four of his men .
It began to look as if something was going to happen .
Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike <UNK> side .
No one said a word .
The Anniston manager came right up to the <UNK> in front of Mike .
His face was <UNK> .
`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice <UNK> low , <UNK> .
`` That was a <UNK> thing to do '' .
`` For God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away .
`` Stop it , will you ? ?
Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .
`` You didn't have to <UNK> him '' .
`` That's what you say '' .
The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .
It was a cold and calculated look .
He turned and went back across the field to his <UNK> .
He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , <UNK> built right <UNK> moved out to the mound for Anniston .
The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .
Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .
The first ball the <UNK> pitcher threw came in for <UNK> head .
Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .
He arose slowly and brushed himself off .
He got back into the <UNK> box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .
`` <UNK> the <UNK> '' ! !
Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .
In the Riverside <UNK> Frankie <UNK> , <UNK> , whispered into <UNK> ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' .
`` Look at those bastards '' ! !
Charlie <UNK> , a pitcher , said .
`` They're looking for trouble '' .
Mike was slow getting into the box this time .
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .
`` Listen '' ! !
He shouted to the pitcher .
`` One more and I'm coming out there '' ! !
`` I'll be waiting '' ! !
The pitcher yelled back .
Mike Deegan <UNK> the rubber plate with the end of his bat .
He stood <UNK> in the box , but not very close to the plate now .
The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for <UNK> head .
Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound .
The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan .
They were both walking towards each other , <UNK> .
Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .
In the next moment , it seemed , the <UNK> was crowded with spectators , <UNK> , cops , kids and a dog .
There was much shouting and screaming .
<UNK> sprang up and were quickly <UNK> .
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .
Phil <UNK> and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .
After the game , Phil was taking off his <UNK> in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .
`` It's a <UNK> thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a <UNK> own <UNK> won't come out and help him in a fight '' .
Phil sighed and pulled the wet <UNK> over his head .
Frankie <UNK> sat down on the bench near Phil .
The other players were <UNK> quietly .
Eddie Lee had not come in yet .
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .
`` Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? ?
`` I didn't think it was necessary '' .
`` Well ! !
Now that's just fine ! !
You didn't think it was necessary '' .
Mike placed both his hands on his <UNK> .
He pushed his jaw forward .
`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' .
Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into <UNK> face .
`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .
`` Nobody else did , either '' .
`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .
Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , <UNK> '' ! !
And Phil <UNK> his locker door shut and spun around .
But before anything could happen Frankie <UNK> was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .
`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said .
Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .
He sat down before <UNK> desk .
`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .
`` You get your <UNK> release as of today '' .
<UNK> eyes <UNK> just a trifle .
`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home .
You don't belong in professional baseball '' .
Phil had to clear his throat .
`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? ?
`` No '' , Eddie said .
`` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' .
Phil stood up .
`` Listen ! !
This is the second time .
''
`` <UNK> down , sit down '' , Eddie said .
`` I'm not saying you're yellow .
I am saying you're not a professional <UNK> '' .
Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .
`` Now listen to me , Phil .
I'm not steering you wrong .
You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .
Phil shook his head and Eddie <UNK> .
Suddenly his voice grew hard .
`` What the hell do you think baseball is ? ?
You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? ?
Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .
`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are .
I know you've got talent .
But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with .
The heart , Phil .
You just haven't got the heart for <UNK> , and that's it '' .
<UNK> , Phil said : `` I don't get it .
My batting average ''
Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .
`` What difference does your batting average make ? ?
Or your <UNK> average .
Or even the way you run bases .
I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it .
That's what I mean by no heart for the game .
<UNK> no <UNK> .
Deegan had no business <UNK> into that kid out there .
He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on .
What the hell do you think baseball is ? ?
A sport ? ?
It's a way of life , <UNK> ! !
And you've got to be ready to cut to <UNK> anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! !
He's wrong ! !
Phil thought .
It's only his opinion .
There were other clubs in this league .
He stood up slowly .
He was a little pale and <UNK> .
His lips felt glued together .
`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .
Eddie nodded .
`` Okay .
You'll get your pay in the morning '' .
Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` <UNK> you'll see I was right '' .
Phil shut the door behind him .
Outside in the dressing room , Frankie <UNK> sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Frankie asked .
Phil said : `` I got my release '' .
`` You crazy '' ? ?
Phil shrugged .
`` What for '' ? ?
Phil sighed .
Frankie shook his head .
`` I don't get it '' .
`` I don't know '' , Phil said .
They were silent for a few moments .
Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? ?
Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .
Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .
`` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said .
`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .
The leagues are full of guys like that '' .
Phil was very quiet .
`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? ?
Phil did not answer .
`` Why not try another club '' ? ?
Phil looked up .
What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? ?
`` <UNK> in tomorrow '' , Frankie said .
`` <UNK> to <UNK> Jackson '' .
He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .
`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?
`` Do what '' ? ?
`` Ask <UNK> for a job '' .
Phil nodded .
`` Sure '' , he said .
`` <UNK> come in tomorrow '' ? ?
Frankie nodded .
`` I'll speak to <UNK> '' .
`` <UNK> boy '' .
`` I'll talk to him , all right '' .
`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said .
`` You'll get a job there .
He needs <UNK> bad '' .
`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said .
`` That's the way to talk .
What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ?
`` Nothing '' , Phil said .
<UNK> next interest seemed the product of his <UNK> .
His broad reading took him into certain <UNK> of religion and the subject of religion began to <UNK> him .
When he was twelve he took to reading St. <UNK> and <UNK> , then <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> by endless <UNK> and numerous <UNK> papers .
For his birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the <UNK> and a little image of the Indian god , <UNK> .
And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the <UNK> , which she suspected Richard would enjoy .
He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read .
At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' .
`` Did you think there were two '' ? ?
<UNK> his father .
`` You don't understand '' , Richard said <UNK> .
Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' .
Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again .
His interest in the formal study of religion <UNK> when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs .
Although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies .
Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his <UNK> , a thorough if <UNK> knowledge of Asian <UNK> , literature , life , politics and history .
He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of <UNK> , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country .
The week at home was not comfortable .
His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an <UNK> which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be <UNK> .
She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested .
`` Do you still have The Book of the <UNK> '' ? ?
She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' .
`` Yes '' , he <UNK> to <UNK> the conversation , `` I still have it '' .
He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
As for The Book of the <UNK> , it along with his other books on religion had been <UNK> in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York .
He had <UNK> each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .
Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of <UNK> and , on the <UNK> which took him to Japan , he <UNK> at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he <UNK> <UNK> an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard .
During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure .
He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a <UNK> North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water .
It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the <UNK> rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it .
It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind .
In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend .
An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident <UNK> to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her .
He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
In Charlotte , Richard saw a <UNK> and a <UNK> for doing things which , after a fashion , he <UNK> .
In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity .
She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small <UNK> parties she held at her rooms and in the end he <UNK> with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .
At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at <UNK> today .
Have you ever been to <UNK> '' ? ?
No one had .
`` Well , it's at <UNK> and there was a <UNK> young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .
I was thoroughly startled '' .
Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but <UNK> manner during the <UNK> was more <UNK> and <UNK> than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the <UNK> words which had preceded it .
Three of the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which Zen philosophy was used as the <UNK> .
<UNK> , <UNK> and tea were In because they could be taken <UNK> .
<UNK> was Out because it was <UNK> .
<UNK> was In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little <UNK> .
Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the <UNK> nearly painful to his ears .
`` He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte .
`` Did you watch him '' ? ?
Asked a <UNK> girl named <UNK> <UNK> .
`` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' .
`` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of <UNK> .
`` For a minute , anyhow .
I'm surprised no one has been there .
I've been there a number of times .
Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo .
You've never been to <UNK> '' ? ?
`` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said .
`` There's a little place there called <UNK> <UNK> dedicated to <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
`` Yes , a little <UNK> place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` <UNK> , it's all very nice .
And the man who brought sweet potatoes into <UNK> is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of <UNK> .
Oh , that's what I meant to tell you .
This is the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a <UNK> habit of trying to pull him into the talking .
`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' --
`` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns .
`` <UNK> or <UNK> '' .
`` And the water would be still <UNK> '' , <UNK> seemed to <UNK> at the thought of it .
`` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath .
It would kill one of us '' .
`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at <UNK> , all in worship of <UNK> , the god of fire '' .
<UNK> dark eyes came up and seemed for the <UNK> moment to reflect sharp light .
It was true ; ;
<UNK> , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of <UNK> .
The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening .
He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall .
He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy <UNK> of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching .
Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the <UNK> and the <UNK> at <UNK> , he was unable to put it together .
That night , after leaving <UNK> apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room .
When he at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of <UNK> , thinking first of <UNK> tale of the man at <UNK> , then of his biwa and the <UNK> Pacific waters .
And the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to <UNK> and walked to <UNK> .
He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned .
He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and <UNK> at the two thin falls which dropped from large <UNK> high at the back of the pool .
On the hillside above was <UNK> what might have been an <UNK> of <UNK> , or perhaps a <UNK> .
The strange creature , housed in wire , made him <UNK> .
The sensation he so <UNK> realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be <UNK> to the <UNK> green water or the little <UNK> or the green <UNK> <UNK> beyond his reach .
He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him .
Into a little well before the temple he dropped a <UNK> coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ;
but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest .
Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated <UNK> at their head .
The black <UNK> seemed to stare rigidly back at him and <UNK> eyes were caught by the <UNK> in <UNK> , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of <UNK> face and there was a terrible metallic <UNK> sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it .
Then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently .
Suddenly he <UNK> his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated <UNK> and hurried back down both <UNK> and away from the temple , never looking back .
He walked all the miles back to his room .
He seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small <UNK> and felt a bit hot .
He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at <UNK> .
But the process of refusing to think about it was an active <UNK> in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day .
The cold <UNK> , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the <UNK> sight of burning metal , the <UNK> sound , the <UNK> feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life .
All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at <UNK> .
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the <UNK> field far across the hill from the farm buildings .
It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of <UNK> ground , carrying the jar of cool water .
The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old <UNK> <UNK> or a stick along , to play with .
He <UNK> that the <UNK> was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make <UNK> , tractor sounds with his lips .
I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time .
I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the <UNK> , the snake was there .
It lay half in the <UNK> and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the <UNK> .
The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly .
The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the <UNK> and did not go any further .
I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful .
He was <UNK> and graceful and he lay in the <UNK> and moved his arched and <UNK> head only so slightly .
Go out of the <UNK> , snake , I said , but it did not move at all .
I pulled the <UNK> of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only <UNK> its black , <UNK> tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without <UNK> or concern .
I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it .
My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and <UNK> <UNK> a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly .
I followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its <UNK> back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown <UNK> the size of a <UNK> fist down its back , and the <UNK> were set one within the other and <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> .
The colors were <UNK> , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm .
The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly .
His flat and <UNK> <UNK> head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .
You beauty , I said , I couldn't kill you .
You are much too beautiful .
I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was <UNK> that an animal such as that should die .
I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and <UNK> and only a little wildly , and I could feel the <UNK> of that radiant , <UNK> body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little <UNK> in the <UNK> of him , like <UNK> swallowed whole might make .
The body <UNK> through my hands like cool <UNK> , and my hands , usually <UNK> and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the <UNK> of that body .
I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , <UNK> earth , from between my pale hands .
The snake worked away very slowly and <UNK> and with a <UNK> kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled <UNK> .
The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target .
I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake .
It <UNK> in its bright diamond color against the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> black <UNK> of soil and against the <UNK> of myself .
The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and <UNK> field .
I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks .
I had my back to the corner of the <UNK> field that pointed towards the house .
The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the <UNK> because they were not <UNK> properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake .
I saw it all at a glance .
The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the <UNK> earth , <UNK> with <UNK> and a kind of <UNK> impatience .
Even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the <UNK> mark of brutality on the boy .
I could see the <UNK> shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the <UNK> of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick .
Stop it , I shouted , but the <UNK> and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say .
I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that <UNK> , <UNK> dance .
It was no use .
I felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that <UNK> <UNK> , catch the boy in the moment of his <UNK> , and save a <UNK> , a <UNK> , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late .
I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ;
I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on .
My head began to <UNK> , and the <UNK> of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they <UNK> .
I felt the anger mount within me .
The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown <UNK> in the heat of the morning .
I knew the boy well .
He was eleven and we had done many things together .
He was a beautiful boy , really , with <UNK> blonde hair and a smooth and still <UNK> face , and his <UNK> were long and dark and <UNK> , and his eyes were blue .
He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day .
He was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and <UNK> , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well .
I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the <UNK> soil , through something there where I had been not long before .
I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me .
`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ?
He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me .
I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ;
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .
`` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me .
I pointed to the <UNK> , upright stake .
`` Did you do that '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement .
`` I killed a snake ; ;
it was a big one '' .
He tried to take my hand to show me .
`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?
`` <UNK> are ugly and bad '' .
`` This snake was very beautiful .
<UNK> you see how beautiful it was '' ? ?
`` <UNK> are ugly '' , he said again .
`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ?
Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ?
`` <UNK> are ugly and bad , and it might have <UNK> somebody , and they would have died '' .
`` You know there are no <UNK> snakes in this area .
This snake could not harm anything '' .
`` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said .
`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' .
`` You are talking <UNK> '' , I said .
`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' .
`` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted .
`` Nobody likes snakes '' .
`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself .
The boy skipped along beside me , and he was <UNK> with what he had done .
The fire of the colors was gone ; ;
there was a <UNK> <UNK> now ; ;
the colors of its back were dull and <UNK> , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes .
The <UNK> head , so delicate and so cool , had been <UNK> as if in a <UNK> , and the <UNK> tongue <UNK> out of the twisted , torn mouth .
The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .
I <UNK> the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the <UNK> part of its body , between the colored diamond <UNK> .
I touched it and the <UNK> , the <UNK> , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny <UNK> of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it .
And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there .
The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing <UNK> in circles , making the <UNK> tractor sound with his lips .
I'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful .
I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the <UNK> from the <UNK> and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live .
The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake .
`` It's a big snake , isn't it '' ? ?
He said .
`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' .
`` Don't you see what you have done '' ? ?
I said .
`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ?
`` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said .
He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes .
I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the <UNK> brutality .
`` Don't '' , I said .
I could have slapped the boy .
He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side .
I thought , you little <UNK> , you <UNK> , <UNK> , little <UNK> , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes .
I wanted to <UNK> his face , to wipe forever the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do .
Cady didn't come <UNK> easily , but this had not been a day of glad <UNK> .
Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own <UNK> <UNK> , a real <UNK> .
Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .
Yes , the boy's <UNK> were in order -- scholastic <UNK> , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards .
But due to the many applicants on file , would he <UNK> and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?
Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort .
This was it .
This was the letter which would or would not <UNK> his son , David , in Hanford .
His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life .
His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief .
He wondered if he had played it wrong .
Maybe he should have kept in touch .
<UNK> back for <UNK> .
But he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of 1935 .
Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the <UNK> .
It wouldn't help anyway .
Look at Pete <UNK> , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years .
<UNK> son was rejected .
Hanford College , Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades .
Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride .
Good solid B average with a <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK> and science .
Imagine his son being that good in science ! !
Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray <UNK> as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford .
But then , he hadn't studied very hard .
<UNK> elected president of the student body took a lot of time and <UNK> .
He put down his pipe and started to type .
`` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' .
He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College .
He didn't have to be told his son looked like him .
David had the same gray eyes , high <UNK> , dark hair and a certain rugged <UNK> .
<UNK> , <UNK> .
<UNK> , <UNK> .
Health , excellent .
He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence .
`` His interests range from astronomy and <UNK> to electronics , tennis and swimming .
His chief motivation for <UNK> at Hanford is the desire to '' --
Mr. Partlow <UNK> his fist on the <UNK> , <UNK> the letter .
He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build .
How do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do ? ?
That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ?
How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ?
Just give him time , give him a chance .
Cady snapped the <UNK> blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he <UNK> on a salesman who needed to have the <UNK> taken off his thick head .
What a production to make of a letter <UNK> your own son ! !
His <UNK> went up in <UNK> at his <UNK> panic .
He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics .
He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous <UNK> activities .
He belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student <UNK> as well as treasurer of the science club .
He finished with a <UNK> of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter .
There , that did it .
Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to <UNK> .
He <UNK> the <UNK> letter into his coat pocket .
Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything .
After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products .
Anne had a way with words .
Half of it was natural , half was Smith College .
Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college .
A woman had it or she didn't .
Anne had it .
She said what she meant and let it be .
She never got on his back .
He could take the advice or leave it .
He <UNK> as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .
`` You look like you just heard a real <UNK> , Mr. Partlow '' .
Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years .
`` I was just thinking how things have changed .
When I went to college they begged you to come .
Be our guest ! !
It's our pleasure ! !
Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and <UNK> with knowledge '' ! !
Tom slid open the door to the lobby .
`` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow .
My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' .
`` <UNK> to State '' ? ?
`` No .
He's president of the <UNK> club here , you know .
Always <UNK> around with science stuff .
<UNK> bright along those lines , you might say .
He got a science scholarship to Yale '' .
`` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom .
Just fine '' .
As he drove home through the <UNK> traffic , Cady felt the <UNK> growing .
He hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David .
They had all turned down his son .
<UNK> in leadership .
So sorry .
<UNK> interests .
So sorry .
No clear motivation .
So sorry .
He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty <UNK> expensive house that he needed the <UNK> Anne had waiting for him .
But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of <UNK> and tossed salad gave no <UNK> from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .
Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did .
He liked looking at Anne .
Most people did .
He liked her blond hair and the <UNK> of <UNK> across her nose .
From those <UNK> eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did .
She always could sense the <UNK> end of a <UNK> day .
`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?
`` No , I begged off .
<UNK> to do '' .
`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?
`` Why not let him take it , Cady ? ?
I know it is <UNK> , but it's only eight days before <UNK> .
Let's forget the rules '' .
Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered .
David grinned .
<UNK> he put down his <UNK> knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman '' ! !
Cady <UNK> head came up like that of the <UNK> fire horse .
`` I'm sorry , Dave .
The car ? ?
Of course you can have it '' .
Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , <UNK> and with interest .
`` <UNK> anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?
Cady begged the question .
`` Don't worry about it , Dave .
Your acceptance will come through '' .
Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .
`` Don't be too sure , Dad .
Charles <UNK> got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a <UNK> student '' .
Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was <UNK> , a lone <UNK> , and completely <UNK> .
`` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! !
Dave kissed her lightly .
`` <UNK> , my dear parent , are here to stay ! !
Get my old man to bed early .
He looks a little bit <UNK> '' .
Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the <UNK> .
`` Let's go into the library .
You do seem somewhat <UNK> '' .
Cady <UNK> her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable <UNK> room .
`` I didn't know I looked so <UNK> '' ! !
`` <UNK> word , darling .
Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it .
<UNK> any help '' ? ?
`` In a way , yes .
Hanford College hasn't decided on <UNK> application yet .
They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership .
Here's what I wrote '' .
Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was <UNK> .
Already he could feel <UNK> questioning eyes .
`` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student <UNK> for a few days .
That was when half the school was down with flu '' .
`` But he was president '' .
`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club .
He just took over the week Bill <UNK> was in the state <UNK> <UNK> '' .
Cady stuck his jaw out .
`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' .
`` And the swimming team .
No , Cady , he made second team .
Just missed the first '' .
`` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady .
`` Anything else '' ? ?
`` Yes '' , she said quietly .
`` I don't think you've been quite honest , Cady .
It isn't like you .
<UNK> interests .
<UNK> .
He was mad about stars at the age of nine .
<UNK> , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the <UNK> six years ago ! !
Those aren't his interests now '' .
`` What do you suggest '' ? ?
`` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , <UNK> and music '' .
`` Music ! !
He hasn't been to a symphony concert all season '' .
Anne smiled .
`` But he plays bass with Chief <UNK> <UNK> and his Five <UNK> '' ! !
`` You mean that <UNK> <UNK> ? ?
Even in that he never <UNK> like Jack on guitar or <UNK> on <UNK> .
He's -- he's just there , that's all '' .
`` Yes , he's just there .
He keeps the beat going .
He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to <UNK> .
He doesn't like to rise and <UNK> .
Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven <UNK> by next year '' .
Cady appeared slightly <UNK> .
`` All right .
But I refuse to be <UNK> honest and mention Chief <UNK> <UNK> and his Five <UNK> '' .
Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension <UNK> its grip on the back of his neck .
`` Maybe I am <UNK> it a bit , Anne '' , he said .
`` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college .
He has to have leadership as well as grades '' .
Anne folded the <UNK> document .
`` Did you know he is advertising his <UNK> equipment for sale this weekend ? ?
He hasn't used it now for several years .
Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ?
Cady felt the <UNK> as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel .
`` And what would you say he wants to do ? ?
Just what '' ? ?
`` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College .
Why don't you ask him '' ? ?
For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back .
`` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession .
I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' .
Anne picked up the <UNK> she was <UNK> for the hospital <UNK> .
`` Just because your father tried to make a <UNK> out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off .
But <UNK> you've wanted him to conform to your mold .
You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' .
Cady put the <UNK> chip back on his shoulder .
`` Dave has qualities of leadership .
He just hasn't developed them yet .
Give him time '' .
He never will , Cady .
Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people .
All your wishful thinking won't change that .
Remember what you used to say in the Army ? ?
You can't run a war with <UNK> generals and one private '' ! !
Cady walked the block to the <UNK> , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne .
Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all .
And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions .
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .
<UNK> awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind .
When he rose in the morning , the image was still there .
He had always been a <UNK> and <UNK> man .
In his <UNK> days , his bedroom had been <UNK> with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order .
No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .
But it was fun those first days , <UNK> about the trail of <UNK> he left <UNK> across the rug .
There was an <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> refusal to pick them up .
Half <UNK> he enjoyed seeing her <UNK> to lift the things .
He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party .
The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like <UNK> .
Her hair was the color of those <UNK> which in seed <UNK> are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of <UNK> or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad <UNK> of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of <UNK> which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness .
So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair .
Or against her back , pressed on the column of <UNK> , which held her so <UNK> straight and <UNK> , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking <UNK> , like the snapped stem of a <UNK> .
But , to put it <UNK> , nothing snapped .
Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then .
They married .
More he could take at leisure .
All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ?
He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly .
There was too little occasion <UNK> for resistance , the brave strong <UNK> of emotional <UNK> and meeting .
They had left themselves too much to discover .
But , at the start , his new life felt <UNK> .
Good .
It was on the <UNK> day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ?
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor .
`` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! !
Martin gave her a <UNK> <UNK> .
`` I think you'll get tired of them there '' .
In the morning the shorts were where he had left them .
He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did .
It was almost too easy .
For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests .
The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening .
He was wrong .
The rest of the bedroom had been <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> , but in the middle of the carpet lay the <UNK> shorts .
They gave the room a strange note of <UNK> , like a <UNK> on a beautiful face .
He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous .
<UNK> he determined to foil her .
I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ;
my nerves are as strong .
<UNK> rush to the bedroom when the <UNK> <UNK> .
It rang .
Ten minutes early .
Martin was standing a few feet from the front door .
He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away .
Dolores stood <UNK> in the doorway .
He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to <UNK> the shorts .
Martin turned his back .
He strode to answer the bell .
<UNK> hat was deposited in the hall closet .
With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led <UNK> to the bedroom .
Martin strained his ears .
At first he could not be sure .
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there .
A <UNK> of <UNK> slid over their voices .
All evening <UNK> favored him with odd , <UNK> looks .
Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' .
For some reason , this <UNK> in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic .
At last there was a void no one could fill .
The <UNK> went home early .
Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night .
As violently as possible .
But he was so taken <UNK> , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in .
On the contrary , it would only <UNK> his position if he <UNK> , while she stayed calm and <UNK> .
And if he <UNK> after <UNK> at her .
He <UNK> .
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?
At once .
He considered the sober possibility .
In his head was the echo of those <UNK> with <UNK> .
There was something about private feminine <UNK> which always made him feel <UNK> and <UNK> .
He remembered his mother <UNK> with her neighborhood women friends , <UNK> her voice to a penetrating <UNK> which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening .
He could even recall the last time he sat there .
She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` <UNK> Martin said he was sorry .
He <UNK> so <UNK> , I couldn't keep being <UNK> with him '' .
It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ;
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it .
But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , <UNK> ears .
The battle had to be fought .
Let the best sex win .
But his resolution hardly seemed to help .
If the situation had been bad , it now got worse .
About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough .
<UNK> Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to <UNK> the date until he could get away .
Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .
These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment .
Of course , the tours of inspection included the <UNK> shorts .
It was curious how the different visitors took this .
Some tried to ignore the <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> .
Others asked .
Quite a few laughed .
To them all Dolores told a <UNK> and witty tale .
`` It's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin <UNK> , carrying the anecdote through a <UNK> and <UNK> course .
While he waited in the living room .
Once Martin went along .
They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing .
Then one of the guests showed his <UNK> .
`` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ?
Martin would have liked to break the man's neck .
Dolores smiled ; ;
she let the interpretation stand .
Now Martin heard himself give a <UNK> of mock good nature .
With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest --
Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .
They kept up a rigid <UNK> of speaking relations .
But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything .
What to talk about ? ?
Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in <UNK> his possessions .
He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in <UNK> and <UNK> , so his life might <UNK> as little as possible on hers .
The shorts alone remained .
In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying .
The sound of their amazement .
<UNK> : He could hear the word .
The most <UNK> situation .
We were up to visit them and
He had thought her exactly what he wanted .
Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously .
<UNK> his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now .
Everyone would know why ; ;
he would cut a <UNK> ridiculous figure .
He was <UNK> .
Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself .
His mind <UNK> <UNK> , seeking an <UNK> .
<UNK> he had periods of hostile <UNK> in which he determined <UNK> , <UNK> , to live out his life in this fashion .
Nothing would change , nothing would ever change .
When the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before .
In a <UNK> of excitement , he considered his plan .
<UNK> his shorts , he would place something of hers .
<UNK> he would have won an <UNK> moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her <UNK> , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .
He felt that it would be a particular <UNK> to Dolores to pick up her own <UNK> which he had laid on the floor .
Furthermore , he could go on <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a <UNK> , or maybe a <UNK> , next to his shorts .
<UNK> or later , Dolores would crack .
On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which <UNK> the apartment .
Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next <UNK> of her story .
The tale , he thought , would become less gay .
She had used his <UNK> shorts as the very image of his <UNK> , his lack of control , his general male <UNK> , while she remained cool , <UNK> , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an <UNK> body .
To have her <UNK> linked with his on the floor would draw her <UNK> into a struggle both bitter and absurd .
Something in the back of his mind was aware that the <UNK> of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and <UNK> were involved , because it was truly his .
The knowledge kept him from <UNK> his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of <UNK> <UNK> .
The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau <UNK> , took out a pair of <UNK> <UNK> pants , and <UNK> dropped them next to his shorts .
He sat down on the bed .
In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared .
To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two <UNK> .
<UNK> and deliberately she reached down and touched the <UNK> with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second .
Ah , he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too .
He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him .
<UNK> her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room .
She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was <UNK> and her eyes <UNK> .
They <UNK> together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , <UNK> up and down from the table so that talk was impossible .
Well , Martin thought , <UNK> save .
He left for work in high spirits .
As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks .
He found that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a <UNK> of an <UNK> feeling .
`` Good old <UNK> '' , Cap said .
`` You know , I've got one of your cars at home .
As a prominent <UNK> , you ought to be interested in his <UNK> support group .
Isn't his <UNK> down your <UNK> '' ? ?
Once it was , William thought .
But not any more .
A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap .
How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?
<UNK> enough , through the <UNK> agency of his <UNK> .
General <UNK> draft and Doc <UNK> and Cap were responsible for his first <UNK> , but <UNK> Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time .
Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and <UNK> financing by <UNK> , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one .
Mr. Willis bought <UNK> <UNK> Products , a <UNK> corporation of sorts which had undergone many <UNK> and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position .
Shortly after , Freddy had his usual <UNK> of bold ideas .
Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ;
he generally heard <UNK> suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own <UNK> concerns .
Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by <UNK> loyalty and a concern for his <UNK> .
<UNK> began to aid Freddy with her father , <UNK> , no doubt , by <UNK> open contempt for Freddy and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of <UNK> fortune ; ;
she unquestionably assumed that the more he was <UNK> with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy <UNK> upon his death .
Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding <UNK> .
They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized <UNK> company , an organization that built -- very <UNK> -- <UNK> research <UNK> .
Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam <UNK> , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections .
<UNK> his power , Freddy looked for additional <UNK> to <UNK> .
<UNK> industry , <UNK> toward <UNK> government <UNK> , attracted him .
The <UNK> <UNK> Company , a <UNK> firm which manufactured <UNK> vehicles and other <UNK> equipment , had recently constructed an <UNK> , modern plant in a burst of <UNK> optimism .
<UNK> with a <UNK> management and <UNK> stockholders , it was ripe for <UNK> , and <UNK> instinct was to keep growing by stock <UNK> and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences .
With <UNK> blessing , he was convinced that <UNK> Wisconsin <UNK> would be ideal for conversion to airplane <UNK> , tanks , missiles or <UNK> of some kind .
At that point William came into the picture .
Although not much <UNK> the account , he had been appointed advertising head of <UNK> .
<UNK> of routine by having his own firm and a <UNK> partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ;
and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least <UNK> by the chance of wider opportunities .
Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the <UNK> of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .
In the end , he said : `` I'm not <UNK> by the proposition , sir .
I know a guy named Jack <UNK> , a very bright young engineer who was with <UNK> , and I took him with me to <UNK> .
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind .
The conversion will cost a fortune .
Besides that , I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force .
I think Adam <UNK> is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .
<UNK> have thrown everything up for <UNK> , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here .
The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet <UNK> have <UNK> the <UNK> trade -- one jet can take the place of three <UNK> planes .
This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough .
Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled .
Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust <UNK> '' ? ?
Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .
`` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know .
And <UNK> .
Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .
He <UNK> me he has people to handle the money raising , and <UNK> <UNK> , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of <UNK> and <UNK> are no problem .
I don't like to exhibit the deadly <UNK> effect of an elderly man's caution '' .
`` Yes , I appreciate that .
I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm <UNK> ; ;
I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to <UNK> me .
If we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the <UNK> on opposite sides , <UNK> their <UNK> '' .
`` Which is a <UNK> prospect , Bill '' .
Willis laughed .
`` One shouldn't mix commercial affairs with <UNK> , but in this case I have no choice .
Let me think about it .
I'm most grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal <UNK> instead of Freddy '' .
Not to <UNK> surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton <UNK> <UNK> ; ;
allied to them was <UNK> , devoting much time to <UNK> her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was <UNK> to interfere further .
<UNK> absorbed <UNK> , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the <UNK> combination .
Through Jack <UNK> , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for <UNK> and Clay .
He forgot about <UNK> till , <UNK> , he and <UNK> were proved correct .
<UNK> <UNK> dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit .
Adam , <UNK> by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end .
The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white <UNK> .
Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value .
<UNK> by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and <UNK> for a drastic liquidation .
Once more Willis summoned William .
`` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a <UNK> .
<UNK> solution doesn't appeal to me .
In addition to other defects , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment .
Will you see if you can help me '' ? ?
William spent a long week end <UNK> with <UNK> .
His recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of <UNK> useless Wisconsin <UNK> , exposure to exciting conceptions of <UNK> that nobody would buy , and the <UNK> recent failure of a respected but <UNK> <UNK> manufacturer called <UNK> Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to <UNK> it .
<UNK> , <UNK> reaction to <UNK> going into the passenger car market was <UNK> .
He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a <UNK> chain of <UNK> was simply too difficult .
Then he caught fire .
If <UNK> could buy <UNK> <UNK> and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money <UNK> was not <UNK> .
They took nearly a month to investigate , <UNK> statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white .
Taking <UNK> with him , William went to Mr. Willis .
He was surprised and <UNK> , but impressed by the engineer and the report .
`` Your alternative is <UNK> '' , he said , `` and , I'm frank in saying , a bit mad .
I wish I was younger and less <UNK> .
Well , I can't resolve this myself .
I'll have to call in the brain trust .
Are you willing to run the <UNK> ? ?
I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .
`` We'll be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself .
You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage .
If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' .
He paused .
`` I should explain : there's more here for me than <UNK> my little dream , there's you .
You <UNK> take a fall , or publicly back away .
I hate that .
You're -- you're Arthur Willis .
<UNK> the hearts and flowers theme '' .
`` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly .
`` Thank you '' .
At the meeting , attended by Freddy , <UNK> , <UNK> and the <UNK> executive staff , with Mr. Willis <UNK> , William and <UNK> did indeed run the <UNK> .
From shock and <UNK> , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and <UNK> .
`` Oh , my God '' , <UNK> <UNK> said , `` a little child shall lead them .
<UNK> over , General Motors '' .
`` It's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face .
`` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' .
`` Your garden , God damn it '' ! !
William said .
`` I don't enjoy family <UNK> '' , Adam said .
`` Nor crazy relatives .
We're here to <UNK> business .
Can't we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? ?
`` <UNK> me out , please '' , William begged .
`` I'm an advertising <UNK> , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere .
Sure , <UNK> went broke in the <UNK> market <UNK> the Big Three .
Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were <UNK> .
They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit .
We've arrived at an age for romance and <UNK> .
We've all been rich and <UNK> long enough to hate the machine age .
Look what those little European jobs are doing .
We'll <UNK> the consumer with a product , not <UNK> him with <UNK> excess length and weight .
Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a <UNK> , at reasonable rates .
<UNK> folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , <UNK> .
We've got rid of the steam <UNK> and <UNK> houses , and the <UNK> , <UNK> automobile is next .
Why not come down <UNK> in the world , in a <UNK> fashion , with an <UNK> '' ? ?
He swayed them somewhat , but the debate <UNK> on .
<UNK> emerged as the main obstacle .
Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .
`` Nobody will <UNK> it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said .
`` I know what I'm talking about in that department '' .
`` There's plenty of risk money '' , <UNK> <UNK> added , `` but not for anything this <UNK> '' .
`` All right '' , William said .
`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis .
If we can't raise the capital , we're through .
Nothing has been lost .
You're up against it anyhow .
Why won't you give me a chance '' ? ?
A silence fell .
<UNK> <UNK> turned in <UNK> direction .
He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together .
`` I feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the <UNK> later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't <UNK> <UNK> spread broadcast outside my family .
I'm not giving you a chance , Bill , but <UNK> myself of your generous offer of assistance .
Good luck to you '' .
`` All the <UNK> have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and <UNK> at William and Freddy in turn .
<UNK> started out on <UNK> forehead , whether from relief or <UNK> he could not tell .
<UNK> the table , <UNK> <UNK> him <UNK> with an <UNK> thumb and <UNK> .
Nobody else showed pleasure .
<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> with <UNK> glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack <UNK> <UNK> William at the <UNK> club .
`` <UNK> , boss '' , he said , and grinned .
`` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode '' .
`` I'm afraid not '' .
It was among these that <UNK> identified a photograph of Barco ! !
For it seems that Barco , <UNK> himself a <UNK> man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ?
) , had listed himself for <UNK> <UNK> roles at the <UNK> of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! !
Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of <UNK> Barco .
On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main <UNK> to question the <UNK> .
Finally , at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> Station on <UNK> Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San <UNK> .
They headed in that direction and , at San <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission <UNK> , eating a hot <UNK> .
At the moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search .
The <UNK> , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a <UNK> in <UNK> .
The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without <UNK> him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning .
Thus it was that Barco , <UNK> for mere <UNK> , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been <UNK> .
During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand <UNK> They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls '' .
The detective , <UNK> on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the <UNK> citizens of our community who are mentally <UNK> -- that he was a more or less <UNK> `` nut '' ! !
However while in his cell <UNK> trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life .
The attempt had failed because , when <UNK> to cut his <UNK> , this murderer of seven women had <UNK> at the sight of blood .
The jail authorities -- <UNK> no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to <UNK> him ; ;
but the old fellow , a <UNK> <UNK> , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter .
Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case .
A man of <UNK> ambition , with one eye on the <UNK> of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity .
It was reported to <UNK> office that a <UNK> in the city jail had attempted suicide .
Welch wanted to know why .
No one knew .
Now Welch had a <UNK> theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at .
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test .
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their <UNK> by stating <UNK> :
`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! !
It'll be a lot better if you come clean '' .
At first Barco was <UNK> and <UNK> .
But with <UNK> <UNK> pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started <UNK> to one murder after another .
By the time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true .
But if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into <UNK> all over America as the hero of a great murder trial .
Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell .
But to <UNK> <UNK> , the police captain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in Barco's confession .
Barco was clearly a `` nut '' .
It required strength , <UNK> , daring to commit murder .
`` That <UNK> a murderer ? ?
<UNK> '' ! !
Then , for the first time since his arrest , a <UNK> of spirit lit Barco's eyes .
His <UNK> had been attacked .
He stiffened and rose to his feet .
He'd show them ! !
`` Is that so '' ? ?
He <UNK> .
`` Well , for ten years I've been <UNK> women .
I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! !
''
The next day the police captain , in <UNK> , organized what he termed `` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' .
For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on <UNK> murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood .
The searching party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , policemen with <UNK> , newspaper reporters , and <UNK> .
Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a <UNK> which remained his principal attitude from that time on .
He directed the <UNK> of <UNK> to the sand <UNK> near Santa <UNK> .
<UNK> the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two <UNK> sand hills , and indicated a location .
<UNK> were given to dig .
Nothing was found .
Welch was worried .
The police captain <UNK> .
The newspaper boys cracked <UNK> and again Barco's pride was aroused .
With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left .
With <UNK> and <UNK> , the policemen again started <UNK> .
Welch was on edge .
The captain was <UNK> that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the <UNK> struck an object .
`` There's something here '' ! !
Said the <UNK> .
<UNK> stopped and everyone gathered around .
The <UNK> , <UNK> about with his <UNK> , now raised into view a package <UNK> wrapped in one of the <UNK> Hollywood sport <UNK> .
Although it was a mere <UNK> of the <UNK> remains , it was enough .
Welch was wild with delight .
His <UNK> grew as Barco's seven <UNK> brought to light one reward after another .
Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him .
It went to his head , and his ambition increased .
It was apparent that Welch was in <UNK> with Marshall and would use his power as <UNK> to drag every possible sensation into the case .
Every new <UNK> which would provide more `` copy '' for <UNK> pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch .
I knew that both these <UNK> were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand .
Once there , the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> would provide Marshall with <UNK> : `` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' `` Viola Lake an <UNK> '' `` <UNK> of Another <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the <UNK> <UNK> over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! !
I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be <UNK> .
It wasn't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than <UNK> ambition back of his desire for <UNK> destruction .
He was bitter and <UNK> toward her , personally <UNK> .
A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward <UNK> favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had <UNK> a share of them and had then been <UNK> by some <UNK> <UNK> .
I did not rest until I had <UNK> the mystery down .
Well , here it is .
One day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel .
Viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone .
She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ;
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor .
Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all <UNK> to her host .
And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken <UNK> was a small table on which she noted a <UNK> of red <UNK> ; ;
while <UNK> from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as <UNK> would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch .
As Viola sat there , a <UNK> impulse <UNK> her to remove the shoes and <UNK> from the <UNK> feet and , as a <UNK> , insert <UNK> between the toes .
A little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the <UNK> <UNK> on `` The <UNK> Spirit of the <UNK> '' , in the <UNK> room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the <UNK> , was to <UNK> .
He made his way to his <UNK> bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and <UNK> selected his hat from the many on the bed .
Then , noting neither the absence of his <UNK> nor the presence of the <UNK> , he made his way to the <UNK> room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the <UNK> .
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined .
The incident , aside from reflecting on <UNK> political career , had all but <UNK> his home life .
He never rested until he discovered who the <UNK> was , and when he did , he <UNK> vengeance on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way .
And here it was ! !
By such innocent actions are human <UNK> sometimes set in motion .
During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to <UNK> with Viola as I should have liked .
In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet .
We couldn't be seen together , for the tongue of <UNK> was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of <UNK> finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent .
I couldn't invite Viola to our house , for Mother <UNK> refused to receive her .
Now the <UNK> had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had <UNK> a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los <UNK> Society to her .
There , Mother was received by the <UNK> of <UNK> lines which are dominated by the <UNK> ( of beer <UNK> ) , the <UNK> ( of <UNK> origin ) , and the <UNK> ( whose <UNK> founded a nationally famous trade in <UNK> ) .
I hated being dragged into the <UNK> of these <UNK> .
But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone <UNK> connected with the <UNK> is ever received in their exclusive <UNK> .
In fact , it was not until the King of <UNK> had visited at <UNK> that Mary and <UNK> were <UNK> to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and <UNK> from the <UNK> .
Mother even went so far as to <UNK> up for me <UNK> opportunities with <UNK> <UNK> who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more <UNK> Los Angeles area where a <UNK> was a girl who had been to high school .
But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` <UNK> '' in order to spend a <UNK> evening with Viola and her <UNK> at her home .
However , such a <UNK> of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , <UNK> , to my own mother .
When I arrived at <UNK> I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen .
Viola greeted me , in checked <UNK> , <UNK> in hand , and explained it was the <UNK> night out and that she herself was preparing dinner .
I sat and watched proceedings .
There was to be roast chicken with dressing , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , new peas with a <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , and <UNK> potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself .
I realized that <UNK> was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater .
The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. <UNK> tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an <UNK> scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion .
I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly .
Here's a household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone .
No matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their <UNK> , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you <UNK> within seconds after you pick up the phone .
<UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> themselves around me , <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> climbed onto a stool and <UNK> the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency .
Somehow <UNK> to get out a cool , poised , `` <UNK> you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the <UNK> , and with more warmth and less <UNK> , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including <UNK> Island and the <UNK> reaches of <UNK> .
I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed .
Speaking into the phone again and <UNK> the <UNK> , I resumed my everyday voice .
Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like <UNK> holding her breath and pretending to black out , <UNK> <UNK> the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> .
Under the circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there .
I discovered that the girls had <UNK> <UNK> the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room .
It seemed that I would be the <UNK> if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats .
<UNK> to get something done , I started in on the dishes .
No .
I'm not saying it right .
What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink .
They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in <UNK> and starting to <UNK> again , this time about Francesca and her husband .
How about them , I thought .
Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in <UNK> .
We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met <UNK> at a <UNK> meeting , and had taken us in hand socially .
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , <UNK> , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since <UNK> was just a village ; ;
the yellow pages of the telephone book were <UNK> thin ) .
They were `` personalities '' .
<UNK> , an expert on narrow ties , thin <UNK> , and <UNK> , was men's fashion editor of <UNK> , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation .
<UNK> and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from <UNK> , or was it Wyoming ? ?
She was the daughter and sole <UNK> of either a cattle <UNK> or an oil <UNK> and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a <UNK> in various fields .
She <UNK> Greenwich Village artists for <UNK> , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) .
It was during her `` writing '' period that she and <UNK> met and decided that they were in love .
They were married at a <UNK> ceremony which was duly recorded in <UNK> and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they <UNK> in Bermuda .
No , not Bermuda .
Bermuda was not in style that year .
They had <UNK> in Rome ; ;
everyone was very high on Rome that year .
They had bought their house in <UNK> after investigating all the regions of <UNK> surrounding New York ; ;
they had chosen <UNK> because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names .
`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , <UNK> had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just <UNK> little <UNK> and dull husbands , but People Who Do <UNK> '' .
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an <UNK> at their way of always doing the right things .
Their house was a <UNK> <UNK> which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and <UNK> , and added on to .
It had a <UNK> corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud .
It was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the <UNK> room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time .
Their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences .
Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently <UNK> and showed the world they were by filling their <UNK> house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) .
<UNK> <UNK> her independence by <UNK> against the <UNK> uniform of Bermuda shorts and <UNK> <UNK> by wearing Bermuda shorts and <UNK> <UNK> in colors ; ;
bright <UNK> and <UNK> and vivid <UNK> .
Sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , <UNK> black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the <UNK> .
No one could dislike them , I thought .
Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human .
It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles <UNK> , with nice <UNK> .
<UNK> the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ;
even brand names .
You should hear the <UNK> in <UNK> voice when she said `` <UNK> '' or `` <UNK> '' or `` Madame Alexander '' .
She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been <UNK> in <UNK> , and that <UNK> second cousin was an intimate of theirs .
I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of <UNK> were equally <UNK> .
I couldn't feel at home among them .
Besides Francesca , there was Blanche .
Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet .
Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being <UNK> in warm , melted <UNK> .
I had once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum <UNK> , `` Oh , my <UNK> has collapsed '' .
Anyone knows how a real , <UNK> woman would react to such a catastrophe ! !
If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , <UNK> things .
But dear me , no ; ;
not Blanche .
After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the <UNK> of <UNK> , who was a sort of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
Francesca and <UNK> were <UNK> committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected <UNK> , equal <UNK> , of whatever <UNK> or civic project was being launched .
They were <UNK> , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen <UNK> for social leadership .
<UNK> was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , <UNK> <UNK> .
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive .
<UNK> had a small , <UNK> head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast .
She lived in an <UNK> house whose decoration , <UNK> , paint , and even <UNK> were chosen to complement her <UNK> ; ;
the <UNK> were a couple of <UNK> cats .
Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , <UNK> , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost <UNK> , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick .
The husbands of these women and others I had met in <UNK> were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , <UNK> .
I couldn't tell one from the other .
Like Herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising .
One or two were writers of books ; ;
all were fellows of finite charm .
Each had developed a <UNK> <UNK> and the habit of saying `` <UNK> '' ! !
In <UNK> to <UNK> .
I never thought I'd live to hear people <UNK> and say `` <UNK> '' ! !
In real life .
I wouldn't have missed it for anything .
They were `` sincere '' -- men of the <UNK> <UNK> and the urgent smile .
These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they <UNK> , <UNK> with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting .
Could such <UNK> love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ?
They were always <UNK> to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I <UNK> the whole lot of them to the same degree that I <UNK> <UNK> shops that called themselves `` <UNK> Bake <UNK> '' .
`` O ! !
<UNK> ! !
'' I thought , and wondered what kind of <UNK> such odd <UNK> would establish in this suburban frontier ; ;
<UNK> who looked like <UNK> <UNK> even at <UNK> conferences and who never called the school principal `` <UNK> '' .
I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than <UNK> yearly ; ;
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` <UNK> to <UNK> '' ; ;
people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ;
who were more <UNK> than gracious , more personalities than persons .
In my <UNK> , they were people who read <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , and discussed <UNK> ; ;
well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about <UNK> , which they were , because they had no opinions about <UNK> , not having read <UNK> .
They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were .
<UNK> aware that it was nearly <UNK> , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .
I made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen .
Then , I remembered that the girls had had a <UNK> for <UNK> every day for the last week .
`` <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> had shouted each time .
`` They're not <UNK> ! !
They're not even food .
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' .
I dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a <UNK> cake with chocolate <UNK> .
( Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put <UNK> in it , put chocolate in it .
)
The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the <UNK> of taste <UNK> Mama had been providing .
Then <UNK> closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` Take my hand , <UNK> ; ;
I'm a stranger in <UNK> '' .
<UNK> to say , I was <UNK> at this <UNK> <UNK> upon free enterprise .
How dared they demand to `` <UNK> '' in private financial records , <UNK> , <UNK> contracts and agreements ? ?
`` It is as though '' , I said on the historic <UNK> , <UNK> radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father <UNK> and <UNK> the Eddie <UNK> , Manhattan <UNK> and Major <UNK> shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some <UNK> of <UNK> , insisted on reading my <UNK> , <UNK> my <UNK> and <UNK> my <UNK> ! !
'' My impassioned plea for civil rights created a <UNK> of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie <UNK> comedy hour on a permanent basis .
But what quarter could a poor <UNK> woman expect from a <UNK> who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ?
The savage <UNK> <UNK> of red Russian Communism <UNK> on the <UNK> that was mighty <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> with their <UNK> battle cry of `` <UNK> the rich ' ! !
After an <UNK> <UNK> , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained <UNK> from such <UNK> practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I <UNK> inherited as <UNK> helpless <UNK> , was `` <UNK> '' with a personal bill of such <UNK> proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , <UNK> savings .
I was also publicly <UNK> , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such <UNK> publications as The New Republic , The New <UNK> , Time and The Christian Science <UNK> .
It was then that I <UNK> myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax <UNK> .
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .
I fought like a <UNK> but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court ( 1937 ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` <UNK> '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest <UNK> in the land in order to defeat little me .
Presidential <UNK> had succeeded not only in <UNK> the <UNK> , `` <UNK> '' and <UNK> of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so <UNK> as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! !
I was ready , like <UNK> , to present my own brief .
But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! !
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' .
Again , my name was on all the front pages .
I was , it seemed , <UNK> non <UNK> in every quarter , but not entirely without a <UNK> following of noted political <UNK> and students of <UNK> .
As Charles Evans Hughes said , `` Miss <UNK> limitations as an <UNK> are <UNK> only by her logic as a <UNK> '' .
Albert <UNK> was quoted as saying : `` The <UNK> of the woman's mind <UNK> me '' .
Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly <UNK> '' .
<UNK> <UNK> wrote : `` <UNK> <UNK> is the most original <UNK> since <UNK> '' , and even <UNK> had to <UNK> that `` if the rest of this nation showed the <UNK> and <UNK> of Miss <UNK> , America would rapidly <UNK> ancient <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
Not only were the court costs <UNK> , but I was subjected to <UNK> <UNK> , in addition to <UNK> interest on the <UNK> `` debts '' which the government claimed that <UNK> and I owed -- a severe financial blow .
Nor , as <UNK> said , had the <UNK> done my career `` any good '' .
My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` <UNK> <UNK> '' , and even `` <UNK> '' ! !
<UNK> indeed ! !
I point now with pride to the fact that , long <UNK> the Committee on <UNK> <UNK> , the <UNK> Women , the Economic Council and other such notable `` <UNK> '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was <UNK> leading <UNK> against communism , fighting <UNK> `` <UNK> socialism '' against such <UNK> odds as the <UNK> troops of the <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and an army of more than <UNK> million mercenaries whom <UNK> employed <UNK> , through the transparent <UNK> of regular `` relief '' checks .
<UNK> to say , my art suffered drastically during this <UNK> period .
Could it do otherwise ? ?
Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no <UNK> can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her <UNK> , her home and her nation itself are all <UNK> .
Such sweeping <UNK> are hardly <UNK> to `` Oscar '' winning performances .
I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe .
Having ( through my <UNK> effort and devotion ) achieved <UNK> , a fortune and a <UNK> wife at an age when most young men are <UNK> their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all .
Never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow <UNK> -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss <UNK> <UNK> and `` <UNK> '' had never learned his part .
Each time Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and <UNK> while he <UNK> in <UNK> of <UNK> , <UNK> and abuse , <UNK> others , going into `` <UNK> '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , <UNK> off the `` set '' for the rest of the day .
As for his <UNK> , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` <UNK> away '' .
It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even <UNK> bills at his <UNK> and the Los Angeles <UNK> Club .
Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a <UNK> jaw .
( But that is another story .
) As for his private <UNK> , they were rapidly <UNK> in drinking , <UNK> and <UNK> .
More than once I was confronted by professional <UNK> , `` <UNK> '' , loan `` <UNK> '' , <UNK> , `` <UNK> '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to <UNK> my husband's <UNK> losses , `` or else '' I <UNK> to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister <UNK> .
And at three different times during our <UNK> marriage strange girls , with the <UNK> of <UNK> , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had <UNK> their <UNK> children ! !
Having the deepest of <UNK> <UNK> , my heart fairly <UNK> when I thought of the darling pink and white `` <UNK> from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband .
`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .
Letch had made it <UNK> clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter .
I now felt it <UNK> to keep <UNK> in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around .
Her presence only made Letch more distant and <UNK> and , in the hurry of buying <UNK> <UNK> , I had neglected to consider a room for <UNK> , so there was no place to put her , anyhow .
( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these <UNK> little <UNK> of memory .
It almost always works out for the best .
)
Yet I <UNK> this man , Letch <UNK> , why , I cannot say .
With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> , his <UNK> , his indifference , his <UNK> and his abuse .
The times I can recall when I was publicly <UNK> by him -- lovely dinner parties in our <UNK> <UNK> where the <UNK> was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and <UNK> at a table where the <UNK> chair was vacant ; ;
a `` <UNK> party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain <UNK> stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ;
a lovely <UNK> party at <UNK> <UNK> , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` <UNK> '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could .
These are but a sampling of the <UNK> I endured .
As Mrs. Letch <UNK> , was it any wonder that I , once the social <UNK> of <UNK> , was excluded from the smart <UNK> given by the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the <UNK> and such <UNK> , closely knit families as the <UNK> and the <UNK> ? ?
As <UNK> <UNK> conduct increased , our invitations <UNK> and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played <UNK> at a fashionable `` <UNK> '' gathering .
Between 1935 and <UNK> Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both <UNK> and commercially , than the one before it .
Our last joint venture , <UNK> Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother <UNK> , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the <UNK> of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a <UNK> from start to finish .
As I was playing Mother <UNK> , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me .
But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a <UNK> <UNK> who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the <UNK> example of Mother <UNK> .
And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ?
Did he trouble to <UNK> the very small part which I had `` <UNK> '' to his <UNK> , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ?
Did he show the rest of the cast -- <UNK> four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio <UNK> -- or even at all ? ?
He did not ! !
The `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! !
Most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` <UNK> '' , illegal gambling <UNK> , a certain `` residential club for young <UNK> '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club .
Whenever he <UNK> to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> .
He made many <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general .
By the time the film was released we were three million dollars <UNK> , war was <UNK> and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother <UNK> .
Thanks to Letch <UNK> and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and <UNK> .
Only George <UNK> seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss <UNK> has <UNK> the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet <UNK> by Hollywood '' .
But it was small <UNK> .
In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` <UNK> out '' my own husband to a small and most <UNK> studio to make one picture as a form of punishment .
( An actor must have discipline .
) The film was called The <UNK> of <UNK> , which I felt was just what Letch deserved .
It turned out to be a life of Martin <UNK> , of all things ! !
It was a disaster ! !
In clothes , Letch simply did not project .
He was laughed off the screen .
At the same time , however , I <UNK> myself of the services of that great English actor and master of <UNK> , Sir <UNK> Pratt , to do a `` <UNK> '' called The <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> , in which I played a young American girl who <UNK> a haunted <UNK> on the English <UNK> which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , <UNK> to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric <UNK> .
It was a `` <UNK> '' made on a `` <UNK> '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal .
My heart was not in it , but , <UNK> enough , it remains the most <UNK> successful picture of my career .
( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later .
)
Letch had returned from his <UNK> <UNK> and more badly behaved than before .
I really loved that boy , and , in a <UNK> attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to <UNK> the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to <UNK> , hoping that her earthy advice would help me .
`` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his <UNK> energy '' , I said .
`` What is Letch interested in '' ? ?
`` <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> '' , <UNK> said <UNK> .
Her reply <UNK> me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference .
`` I can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said .
Up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it .
It wasn't his fault that these things were so .
The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its <UNK> of details which must be cleaned up immediately .
As a result , life had become a kind of continuous <UNK> .
Once he disposed of these items which screamed so <UNK> for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted .
Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just <UNK> through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs .
His dogs ? ?
He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams .
Then they had always been <UNK> around him on these walks , <UNK> with delight , <UNK> off into the bushes on <UNK> hunting <UNK> , returning to jump up on him <UNK> with muddy <UNK> .
<UNK> did something to one's ego .
They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys .
<UNK> of how much of a <UNK> you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference .
Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture .
What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? ?
You certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous <UNK> .
Why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ?
It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day .
He would wake up in the middle of the night and <UNK> about it .
How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a <UNK> brief case ? ?
Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ?
Could it be that it <UNK> up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were <UNK> through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ?
Or was the answer less metaphysical ? ?
Did older people work more slowly ? ?
Did it take a man of <UNK> longer to write a letter , <UNK> , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ?
Did men become <UNK> as they grew older , <UNK> , <UNK> , reluctant to let go ? ?
It might be that certain people were born with a <UNK> to <UNK> their lives , while others could live <UNK> <UNK> almost <UNK> , like <UNK> in the sun , too <UNK> to <UNK> their eyes .
Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , <UNK> way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively <UNK> to it .
And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , <UNK> , <UNK> , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them .
There was no <UNK> behind them .
They could be done or left <UNK> and nobody really gave a damn .
During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done .
This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed <UNK> to do anything for which no one was waiting .
He looked at the luminous <UNK> of his wrist watch .
It was five minutes after four .
On some distant farm a <UNK> <UNK> and , far down the valley , an associate answered .
He turned over <UNK> and pulled the sheet over his head against the <UNK> <UNK> of the dawn .
At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop .
Thus committed , action might follow .
He went down to Mills and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bought a full set of <UNK> tools , including a <UNK> power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for <UNK> and <UNK> , whatever they were .
He also bought a huge square of <UNK> for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> nails , levels and T squares and <UNK> lines and several <UNK> that he had no idea how to use or what they were for .
`` There '' , said Mr. Mills .
`` <UNK> get you started .
Best not to get everything at once .
Add things as you find you need 'em '' .
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection .
After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that .
When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , <UNK> had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car .
He was glad .
It gave him a chance to <UNK> the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a <UNK> of acid comments .
He had made such a <UNK> about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable .
He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall .
That was where the <UNK> would go on which he would hang his hand tools .
In front of it would be his <UNK> .
The old nightmare which had caused him so many <UNK> hours came <UNK> in on him once more , only this time he couldn't <UNK> it with a sleeping pill and send it away .
How in the world did one attach a <UNK> to a stone wall ? ?
How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ?
After the <UNK> there would be the <UNK> .
He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem .
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric <UNK> .
But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ?
It all seemed rather hopeless .
He turned his attention to the <UNK> .
Perhaps that was the first thing to do .
A <UNK> had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't <UNK> like a <UNK> calf and ultimately <UNK> when you leaned on it ? ?
Mr. Mills had done some <UNK> on a <UNK> of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and <UNK> which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a <UNK> .
They lay on the cellar floor in a <UNK> pile .
Mr. Crombie <UNK> at it <UNK> with his foot .
How could anyone know what to do with an <UNK> like that ? ?
Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the <UNK> and build the <UNK> -- someone who knew what he was about .
Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on .
After that everything should be simpler .
He went upstairs to phone <UNK> .
To his amazement he reached him .
Mr. <UNK> was laid up with a bad cold .
He didn't seem to think that <UNK> a <UNK> to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the <UNK> equally lightly .
The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job .
That was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch .
No , he didn't know of any <UNK> .
There wasn't any such thing any more .
<UNK> all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could <UNK> nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job .
There was a fellow named Blatz over <UNK> way .
Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk .
Mr. <UNK> would probably see him at <UNK> Meeting the next night .
If he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie .
Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest <UNK> that had come into Mr. <UNK> life since he moved to <UNK> , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him .
He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the <UNK> in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you .
So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. <UNK> mind from funny things .
At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached <UNK> to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance .
While Mr. Blatz was putting up the <UNK> and starting the <UNK> , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about <UNK> the whole end of the cellar .
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty .
Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards <UNK> over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the <UNK> , which he then stained and <UNK> according to his taste .
`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some <UNK> for them power tools ; ;
then a couple of <UNK> <UNK> over the <UNK> <UNK> I guess we're about through down here '' .
It all did look very efficient and <UNK> .
There was no question of that .
`` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered <UNK> , `` them power tools needs extra voltage .
I guess you know about that .
Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new <UNK> box for the extra <UNK> .
That ain't too bad <UNK> the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do <UNK> '' .
Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved .
At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools .
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs .
As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking <UNK> .
Mr. Blatz sat down in the only <UNK> kitchen chair .
`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there .
He <UNK> be able to build a new house with all them <UNK> '' .
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .
`` I was just <UNK> to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing .
`` Oh , that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie .
`` I have a thousand things for you to do .
<UNK> that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- ''
`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie .
`` Those are the things I can do , now that I'm set up '' .
`` I've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said .
`` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- <UNK> be plenty more '' .
But the discussion was academic .
Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink .
<UNK>
Nothing in English has been <UNK> as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences .
Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg .
You explain English by Greek '' .
Richard <UNK> <UNK> said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' .
And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' .
There are many types of <UNK> and many of them have been described by <UNK> under such names as <UNK> , <UNK> , and other <UNK> .
In common <UNK> they would be described as <UNK> -- <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .
One species of <UNK> tries to <UNK> by <UNK> repetition .
`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ? ?
Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ?
Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> of a <UNK> kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in .
`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a <UNK> .
`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to <UNK> my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have <UNK> me '' .
<UNK> Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women .
Another case involves a newspaper reporter who <UNK> up a politician .
`` Mr. Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having <UNK> the contradiction of your original statement .
Now would you care to have us say that you were <UNK> in regard to it '' ? ?
<UNK> like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever <UNK> an experienced politician .
They recall <UNK> classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' .
Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in <UNK> fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement .
`` I fear explanations <UNK> of things explained '' , he said , leaving the <UNK> bit -- and bitter .
The <UNK> of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks .
`` Senator '' , said an <UNK> , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' .
`` Good '' ! !
<UNK> the Senator .
`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' .
The <UNK> <UNK> is another species more honored in the <UNK> of <UNK> than in the <UNK> .
This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word .
A verse familiar to all <UNK> is the <UNK> : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a <UNK> <UNK> .
Now can you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me '' ? ?
The `` <UNK> '' <UNK> of <UNK> , another <UNK> of this sort , had endless variations .
`` There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith '' .
`` What's the name of his other leg '' ? ?
Another stock <UNK> <UNK> ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' .
When radio came in , it continued the <UNK> <UNK> in its <UNK> as a standard device .
`` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with <UNK> on '' ? ?
`` I see the girl but I don't see the car with <UNK> on '' .
In recent years <UNK> have discovered this brand of <UNK> and thus the <UNK> <UNK> has acquired a new habitat in the <UNK> .
In one <UNK> a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the <UNK> : `` <UNK> me , but when we came out we found that we had left my <UNK> <UNK> and my wife's behind '' .
<UNK> supplies us with an endless run of such <UNK> .
Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` <UNK> must be of a person not larger than Af inches '' .
<UNK> ads are also <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal <UNK> , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent .
<UNK> takes in five counties , two <UNK> '' .
Since <UNK> is the soul of <UNK> as well as wit , newspaper <UNK> continually provide us with amusing samples .
`` <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> .
Many <UNK> in <UNK> .
Son and <UNK> of Local <UNK> <UNK> '' .
Apart from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , journalism contributes a wide variety of <UNK> <UNK> in both editorial and advertising matter .
A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their <UNK> '' .
An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a <UNK> , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' .
Then there was the <UNK> ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ?
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' .
The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical .
This slip is so-called because its <UNK> English always seems to refer to a <UNK> anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say .
<UNK> : He walked in upon her invitation .
She kissed him <UNK> upon his <UNK> .
He kissed her back .
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called <UNK> <UNK> .
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs .
`` While Henry Morgan was <UNK> Miss <UNK> Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square '' .
Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N -- was injured is <UNK> <UNK> '' .
The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar <UNK> device , as in the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> .
When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the <UNK> <UNK> , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' .
<UNK> enough , this always brought the house down .
Apart from <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , the anatomical is also found in <UNK> literature .
A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor .
Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case .
It read : `` <UNK> in the <UNK> region '' .
After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she <UNK> into the record : `` <UNK> in the woods '' .
There are many grammatical <UNK> other than <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> which permit two different interpretations .
At the home of a <UNK> the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving .
`` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the <UNK> explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' .
The maid <UNK> .
`` That's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said .
But since the <UNK> insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl <UNK> agreed .
So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth .
Another specimen of such <UNK> is illustrated by a woman in a department store .
She said to the <UNK> , `` I want a dress to put on around the house '' .
The puzzled <UNK> inquired , `` How large is your house , <UNK> '' ? ?
This <UNK> was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department .
When a customer asked for <UNK> shoes , she said , `` What size is your <UNK> '' ? ?
The <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an extensive class of comedy .
One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing .
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea .
`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she <UNK> .
`` It was only the other day that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' .
This <UNK> lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence .
`` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , I may not '' .
The girl nodded <UNK> .
`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ?
An <UNK> mother said to her modern daughter , `` You must have gotten in quite late last night , dear .
Where were you '' ? ?
The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- I don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a <UNK> little night club -- I forget the name of it .
Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? ?
Her <UNK> parent agreed .
`` Of course , dear '' , she said .
`` It's only that I like to know where you go '' .
No less ambiguous was the <UNK> of a certain <UNK> sermon .
`` <UNK> beloved '' , he <UNK> , `` unless you <UNK> of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' .
This clergyman should have referred to Shakespeare's <UNK> : `` <UNK> is a good , very good , very excellent <UNK> .
And yet it is not .
It is but <UNK> '' .
<UNK> reference also carries <UNK> where an <UNK> to one person or thing seems to refer to another .
A news item described the <UNK> of a ship : `` <UNK> the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid <UNK> down the ways into the sea '' .
This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool : `` Four trucks to Fort Mason <UNK> , <UNK> tonight , for <UNK> girls to dance .
The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' .
A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died .
`` What are my chances for taking <UNK> place '' ? ?
He asked .
`` If you can fix it up with the <UNK> '' , returned the politician , `` it's all right with me '' .
The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally <UNK> .
`` What have you got on today '' ? ?
She inquired .
`` A blue suit '' , he answered .
`` Who's in it '' ? ?
She continued .
`` I am '' , he said .
There was a short pause for reflection .
`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' .
Another brand of <UNK> reference arises out of the use of the double <UNK> .
When a question contains two <UNK> , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered .
The <UNK> night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her <UNK> for some time .
Finally he asked , `` Do you object to <UNK> '' ? ?
`` That's one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly .
He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean <UNK> '' ? ?
`` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' .
<UNK> to requests for character reference are <UNK> for their <UNK> <UNK> .
It would be hard to find anything more <UNK> than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' .
Another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` The <UNK> of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction .
If you are thinking of giving him a <UNK> , be sure to make it a wide one '' .
In the comedy of <UNK> reference , <UNK> <UNK> a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence .
<UNK> arises when the <UNK> it carries a <UNK> reference .
Two friends were talking .
One said , `` When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' .
The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold .
<UNK> is a <UNK> because it covers <UNK> as well as wit .
An excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` Doctor , please come over right away .
My husband is in great pain .
I called the other afternoon on my old friend , <UNK> Moreland , the <UNK> literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a <UNK> cottage on the <UNK> <UNK> , raising hell and <UNK> , the former only when the <UNK> gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is <UNK> and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor .
My <UNK> friend does not believe that human stature is <UNK> in terms of speed , momentum , <UNK> , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind .
After <UNK> became the <UNK> Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in <UNK> , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly .
A <UNK> place is in the <UNK> '' .
`` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand .
`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live .
Did you go to their funeral '' ? ?
`` I was wrong '' , I admitted .
`` <UNK> didn't die , it just went crazy .
It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to <UNK> .
We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror <UNK> , magazines known as <UNK> <UNK> , and sick <UNK> .
There are even publications called <UNK> and <UNK> .
The <UNK> is not crazy as a <UNK> or mad as a March <UNK> ; ;
it is <UNK> as a man '' .
`` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` <UNK> Lewis Carroll .
Do you want to hear the <UNK> '' ? ?
`` Can I bear it '' ? ?
I asked , taking a final <UNK> of my drink , and <UNK> him the empty glass .
`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his <UNK> : `` The time has come '' , the <UNK> said , `` To speak of <UNK> things , Of shots and <UNK> , and <UNK> <UNK> Of <UNK> and <UNK> '' .
Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' .
`` I'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking .
`` Oh yes , the other day I <UNK> some of <UNK> English <UNK> , and there was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more than a hundred years ago .
In the railway station at Berlin , a <UNK> attendant was <UNK> , ' <UNK> this way ! !
<UNK> this way ' ! !
One woman -- she could have been either English or American -- went up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners ' '' .
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph <UNK> <UNK> for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' .
`` What's the matter with the music '' ? ?
Moreland asked .
`` It doesn't <UNK> out the dialogue '' , I explained .
`` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said .
`` I am told that in America you have <UNK> by <UNK> , brought out by <UNK> for <UNK> .
Is it all <UNK> '' ? ?
`` There is <UNK> and non <UNK> '' , I said .
`` Speaking of <UNK> : the other day , in a story about a <UNK> demonstration , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The <UNK> became <UNK> .
And then Eichmann was quoted as saying , in <UNK> , that <UNK> plan to <UNK> the Jews was nonsense '' .
`` If we cannot tell evil , horror , and <UNK> from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? ?
Moreland asked , grimly .
`` <UNK> '' , I said .
`` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ?
In our present era of Science and <UNK> , the heart has been <UNK> , to use one of our popular <UNK> <UNK> '' .
`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed .
`` Last year your Tennessee Williams told our <UNK> Powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the <UNK> to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart .
Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed <UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> , and the <UNK> central nervous system .
I'm not pleading for the heart that <UNK> up when it <UNK> a <UNK> in the sky , or for the heart that with <UNK> <UNK> and dances with the <UNK> .
The sentimental pure heart of <UNK> is gone with the <UNK> years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks '' .
`` We no longer have Tom <UNK> and <UNK> ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said .
`` Moore and <UNK> didn't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said .
`` One day our species promises <UNK> , and the next day it <UNK> <UNK> '' .
We sat for a while drinking in silence .
`` The heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes .
When it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was '' .
There was a long silence .
`` You have visited England five times in the past <UNK> , I believe '' , my host said .
`` What has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? ?
`` I would say depressed , not impressed '' , I told him .
`` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into <UNK> <UNK> for sex <UNK> , involving <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> and patients .
It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political <UNK> from the modern theatre '' .
`` Do you think we need a new Henry James to <UNK> the <UNK> scene '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Or perhaps a new Noel <UNK> '' ? ?
`` But you must have heard it said that the <UNK> disappeared forever with the <UNK> years of James and the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> .
I myself hear it said constantly -- in <UNK> .
In them , there is usually a group of <UNK> with <UNK> problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' .
I stood up and began <UNK> .
`` If you are trying to get us out of the <UNK> , the <UNK> , the kitchen sink , and the <UNK> <UNK> , you are probably <UNK> your time '' , Moreland told me .
`` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the <UNK> or from under the rock '' .
`` <UNK> and <UNK> '' , I said .
`` I am worried about the current meanings of the word funny .
It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ;
disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ;
and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights '' .
Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink .
He took his glass , <UNK> it against mine , and said , `` <UNK> <UNK> , what the hell '' ! !
<UNK> a line from Don <UNK> <UNK> .
`` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change .
It now means , in my country , <UNK> '' , I said .
`` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an <UNK> .
Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was <UNK> '' .
My host went over and stared out the window at his <UNK> ; ;
then he turned to me .
`` Is it true that you believe the other animals are <UNK> than the human species '' ? ?
`` Oh , that is <UNK> '' , I told him .
`` Do you remember the woman in the French <UNK> who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun <UNK> <UNK> ? ?
She told the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end ' ! !
And the sheep said -- all in <UNK> , I have no doubt -- <UNK> ! !
The sound <UNK> of sheep is like the <UNK> horse laugh '' .
`` That is only partly <UNK> '' , he began .
`` If you saw the drama called <UNK> '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of <UNK> when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a <UNK> .
The <UNK> would panic , screaming help ! !
-- if that can be screamed in their language '' .
`` You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ?
Moreland demanded .
`` <UNK> , no '' , I said .
`` The political and intellectual Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy .
Nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the <UNK> of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the <UNK> <UNK> , has become a <UNK> actor , or thinks he has .
In his famous meeting with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed <UNK> .
But , like <UNK> , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out .
It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the <UNK> to look after the <UNK> .
Why in the name of his <UNK> doesn't he vary it a bit '' ? ?
`` Such as '' ? ?
Moreland asked .
`` Such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the <UNK> to protect the <UNK> ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' '' .
`` You and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed .
`` What a <UNK> fall was there '' ! !
I said .
Moreland went over to stare at his <UNK> again , and then came back and sat down , <UNK> .
`` The world that was once <UNK> and <UNK> '' , he said , `` has now become <UNK> and <UNK> .
In our age of Science and <UNK> it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space '' .
`` The human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic <UNK> fruit <UNK> .
It seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' .
`` Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested .
`` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said .
`` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the <UNK> tendency of our species to believe in the <UNK> of its religions , its <UNK> , and its virtually everything else .
Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it <UNK> in something else ? ?
<UNK> years ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in <UNK> of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' <UNK> George for <UNK> England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dead ' '' ! !
`` There was also <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , or if you will , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
It isn't what the <UNK> believes in , but what he <UNK> , that puts the world in <UNK> .
This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> to become head of a state .
<UNK> power not only <UNK> but it also <UNK> the mad .
There is a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' .
`` Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said .
`` But we now find writers <UNK> by the <UNK> and <UNK> of their ivory <UNK> , and curiously devoted to the growing <UNK> and complexity of poetry and <UNK> .
I wrote a few years ago that one of the <UNK> rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about .
One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General <UNK> horse .
They wanted to see what his back felt like -- the <UNK> .
He looked so comfortable being straight .
They wanted to touch the mystery .
Arlene was <UNK> them up when the policeman came by .
He was very <UNK> .
Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time .
The <UNK> eyes rather <UNK> for a second ; ;
but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' -- .
The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all .
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the <UNK> cannot be crawled on '' .
Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .
The policeman walked on , but he looked back once .
That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred .
Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ;
and they had told their mother about the <UNK> .
In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ;
and so they were consistently true to their principles .
`` Never mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual <UNK> course of <UNK> .
`` Never mind .
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' .
`` What is it '' ? ?
Asked the children , whose <UNK> and replies were invariably so <UNK> normal and <UNK> .
Maybe that was why they were <UNK> and loyal towards the <UNK> of Arlene .
`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , <UNK> the dialogue in a recent British movie .
And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most <UNK> magnificent time .
First , Arlene had put them through some rapid <UNK> .
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise .
`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were <UNK> the pleasantly <UNK> <UNK> of that handy little sturdy statement .
`` This is a <UNK> '' .
`` Is it anything like <UNK> <UNK> '' ? ?
Asked one of the children .
`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped .
One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions .
Those were especially the ones that all other <UNK> laughed at <UNK> .
She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously .
But not hard for very long .
Just long enough to make you feel important .
`` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live <UNK> , the sort of root that divided itself and made their <UNK> <UNK> down and feel comfortable .
`` Now , we're going to be like what General <UNK> and his horse make us think of '' .
The children looked at each other and <UNK> their <UNK> down even more comfortably than ever .
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds .
Then , Arlene threw herself <UNK> and <UNK> in a way that was just wonderful .
She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked .
`` Imagine being able to laugh and <UNK> when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said .
They both laughed and winked back .
`` I'm General <UNK> horse , <UNK> down '' , Arlene said , sort of <UNK> , for her : even she had to <UNK> kind of funny when she was in that position .
She made General <UNK> <UNK> belly do so funny when it was <UNK> down .
Then , she was back on her feet , <UNK> and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) .
And she would <UNK> and throw <UNK> .
They both tried to keep smiling and <UNK> for a long time , but it made their lips and <UNK> tremble .
But they kept on <UNK> for a long , long time .
`` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on <UNK> a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing .
It all has something to do with General <UNK> and his horse '' .
This time , it was so grand ; ;
they could tell exactly what it was .
It was General <UNK> horse running in a circle .
His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his <UNK> to his shoulders .
`` That's the <UNK> horse '' , one of them cried out .
The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse '' .
The first one said , `` He sure does shake .
He's old '' .
Then there was the General <UNK> his wife .
They had to be told that one .
But it was even <UNK> after they had been told .
Their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just <UNK> their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the <UNK> and put them in the electric <UNK> .
But not General <UNK> .
He was the <UNK> man .
He never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet .
Then , they had to get up and be General <UNK> .
Or his horse .
All they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out .
It wasn't very funny .
Then , they said General <UNK> was going to jump over his <UNK> head ; ;
and they did some <UNK> .
But that wasn't very funny , either .
`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them .
And Arlene showed them how to begin .
She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could <UNK> like my sister Kate '' .
That helped a lot .
They were <UNK> , but they were beginning to catch on .
They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling .
`` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested .
That helped a great deal .
They were a little late in getting home .
`` I'm sorry , Mrs. <UNK> '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it .
My mother constituted herself the voice of all of us .
`` It's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way .
`` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? ?
`` Yes , <UNK> '' , the children <UNK> heartily .
We couldn't help laughing .
The children rushed off to get rid of their <UNK> ; ;
and Arlene began <UNK> the kitchen door open .
`` <UNK> a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ;
but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded .
That tap had a slight <UNK> quality .
`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed .
Her upper lip lifted slightly .
She was <UNK> into a small red <UNK> ; ;
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the <UNK> of the thing .
Also , she lived in <UNK> fear of finding a white <UNK> curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the <UNK> .
She would try to see over the <UNK> of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was <UNK> .
It never worked , naturally ; ;
but it made her look unusual .
Also , when she had <UNK> off half of the small <UNK> , she found the <UNK> <UNK> ; ;
and she would <UNK> the <UNK> half of the <UNK> out to where she could inspect it .
One could hear a very faint , <UNK> sigh of relief .
Actually , it was <UNK> to anyone not expecting it .
But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public .
Later on , the children told her further about <UNK> .
`` It must be awfully good for them .
And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later .
`` But do you know something curious '' ? ?
She added .
`` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress .
I have no notion why I reached .
And I found a <UNK> .
Was it an <UNK> ? ?
I thought for a second .
But I would not <UNK> myself in that silly way .
I opened the window and threw the <UNK> out '' .
Then , my mother <UNK> at this small lie ; ;
for she knew and we knew that it was <UNK> that had made one more <UNK> that night just too impossible a strain .
Arlene became indispensable ; ;
nobody could have told why .
But she was .
It was in the air .
A friend of my father's came to dinner .
He was passing through town and <UNK> to say <UNK> .
As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner .
As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months .
Sometimes , he <UNK> with my father's being at home .
Sometimes , as at this <UNK> , he did not .
But he was always persuaded out .
He liked children , in a <UNK> kind of way ; ;
the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through <UNK> for his entertainment .
When he had left , I could never remember whether he had <UNK> them in their <UNK> , <UNK> , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not <UNK> to look .
The children <UNK> him , too .
This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of <UNK> distributed over them .
There had been some <UNK> in it , for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a <UNK> bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her <UNK> with a <UNK> .
They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door .
We had just sat down .
`` Tell Mr. <UNK> what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , <UNK> .
There was an air of <UNK> about the children -- even <UNK> for their own principles .
This could be told chiefly from a sort of <UNK> and <UNK> , a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> .
<UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> had brought up bitter problems of administration .
But , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air .
`` We go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said .
`` We have good times '' .
This happy <UNK> <UNK> Mr. <UNK> .
`` You do '' ? ?
He asked , between <UNK> of laughter .
He was forced to wipe his eyes .
`` You don't step on the flowers , do you ? ?
<UNK> '' ? ?
One of the children <UNK> out of range of the <UNK> index finger .
`` No '' , he said .
`` We don't '' .
Mr. <UNK> took a <UNK> of his <UNK> .
He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her <UNK> for <UNK> .
Usually , this was done when attention was <UNK> by someone else's long , <UNK> story .
But this time she was nervous : she was open .
Mr. <UNK> was finally in command of his mind again .
`` Tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? ?
He asked .
This was delivered in a <UNK> way , without <UNK> and <UNK> interest -- an admirable way with children .
Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging <UNK> of the direct command .
This <UNK> the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .
`` We <UNK> '' , one said ; ;
and the other went on to development of the idea .
`` We <UNK> , too '' , he said .
My mother was beside herself with curiosity .
`` Say that again '' , she <UNK> .
She laughed a little and tossed the <UNK> <UNK> around in her glass .
`` You what '' ? ?
She could see that Mr. <UNK> was <UNK> ; ;
the <UNK> in her took over .
She was <UNK> happy .
`` You what '' ? ?
My uncle looked at Mr. <UNK> .
He read Henry James and used to <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> at people .
Mr. <UNK> looked down .
He would not look up .
He was very funny about the whole thing .
<UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> ad <UNK> <UNK> , a delightful <UNK> set in the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> War Rome .
<UNK> , the hero , is <UNK> from all sides by the problems of approaching <UNK> .
The story opens on the <UNK> of his <UNK> birthday , as he <UNK> for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow .
Suddenly , a messenger <UNK> and , just before <UNK> dead at his feet , <UNK> him that the <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> , the home province of his <UNK> .
He at once <UNK> the <UNK> and , <UNK> on his <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing <UNK> .
The Albany <UNK> <UNK> presentation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , with guest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of <UNK> from the rock by the U.S. Cavalry was given last week in the <UNK> of the Albany <UNK> <UNK> Company amid <UNK> of `` <UNK> <UNK> '' and `` <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
After a `` busy '' <UNK> , the curtain rises on a farm scene -- the <UNK> Valley in northern Maine .
A dead <UNK> , the sole <UNK> of the stage , <UNK> the crisis and destruction of the Old Order .
Old Order , acted and <UNK> sung by <UNK> <UNK> , the lovely <UNK> import , then entered and delivered the well-known <UNK> to the god <UNK> , <UNK> the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of <UNK> <UNK> priests , <UNK> Love , <UNK> , <UNK> and General Motors , respectively .
According to the myth , Old Order then <UNK> at stage left and <UNK> at extreme stage right , but Director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the rather <UNK> problem of stage effects by simply having Miss <UNK> walk across the stage .
The night he saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the <UNK> , <UNK> -- in <UNK> -- that `` it smelled '' .
We caught the early train to New York .
The <UNK> <UNK> , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
It's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm .
For example , probably very few people know that the word `` <UNK> '' that is <UNK> about so much today stems from the <UNK> `` <UNK> '' : to <UNK> .
<UNK> , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely <UNK> as `` <UNK> '' , `` <UNK> '' , and the <UNK> `` <UNK> '' all originated in the same village in <UNK> <UNK> and are all used to express <UNK> concerning British `` <UNK> '' .
The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start <UNK> them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of Major <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit .
The breeze and <UNK> <UNK> , a movie <UNK> that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to <UNK> a plaster cast of the <UNK> <UNK> .
As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is <UNK> with <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> theory .
For example , when the film is only four minutes old , <UNK> refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` <UNK> '' , and we are <UNK> subjected to a <UNK> that <UNK> us that this very piano stool was once used by an <UNK> <UNK> whose name , of course , was <UNK> ( the English equivalent , when passed through <UNK> <UNK> , of <UNK> ) .
For the remainder of the movie , <UNK> <UNK> proceeds to <UNK> the piano stool with a <UNK> from a <UNK> blind that used to hang in the <UNK> <UNK> .
In this manner , he seeks to <UNK> from his own soul the guilt <UNK> caused by his personal <UNK> against the English at <UNK> .
As we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( <UNK> <UNK> , therefore the English ) that he is <UNK> but the piece of <UNK> blind .
And , when the <UNK> finally <UNK> , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' .
After a few <UNK> moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera <UNK> across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that <UNK> is trying to <UNK> himself in the eyes of a <UNK> piece of sculpture .
The effect , <UNK> to say , is almost <UNK> , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a <UNK> <UNK> for the `` <UNK> '' <UNK> .
The music of <UNK> <UNK> , capital <UNK> <UNK> , one of the rare recordings of this <UNK> , yet <UNK> , composer .
Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the <UNK> Festival in August , <UNK> , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ;
and it is not unlikely that , even as the great <UNK> lay <UNK> for so many years , so has the <UNK> , ingenious <UNK> passed through his `` <UNK> '' of neglect .
But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer <UNK> <UNK> , Jr. , a major <UNK> is under way .
As he leads the <UNK> <UNK> Orchestra , <UNK> gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , including the controversial <UNK> <UNK> , which was included at the <UNK> insistence .
A major portion of the credit should also go to <UNK> <UNK> for his rendering of the almost impossible `` <UNK> '' movement in the <UNK> .
Not only was <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> without <UNK> , but he seemed to take every <UNK> <UNK> in stride .
For example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest <UNK> register up to a barely <UNK> N minor in four seconds , not <UNK> , at the same time , even one of the <UNK> <UNK> , seems a <UNK> too absurd to consider , and it is to the <UNK> credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .
We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it <UNK> an otherwise sober , if not <UNK> , performance .
As Broadway itself becomes increasingly <UNK> down by <UNK> , <UNK> , commercially successful <UNK> and <UNK> problem <UNK> , the American theatre is going through an <UNK> <UNK> in that <UNK> area known as `` <UNK> '' .
For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` <UNK> '' which have left <UNK> , <UNK> impressions on the <UNK> of this veteran <UNK> .
The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical <UNK> is The , an adaptation of <UNK> classic <UNK> by Roger <UNK> , a former University of Maryland chemistry instructor .
Although the play does show a certain structural <UNK> ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the <UNK> <UNK> and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention .
The action centers about a group of <UNK> and <UNK> students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately <UNK> search for a cup of hot coffee .
They are <UNK> <UNK> on all sides by a <UNK> , the police , and an <UNK> government <UNK> .
The innocence that they tried to <UNK> at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of <UNK> pie , gets a plate of English <UNK> instead .
Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as <UNK> said ) , is just a search for the <UNK> cup of hot coffee , and that this <UNK> , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks <UNK> retired .
<UNK> but still <UNK> , French <UNK> <UNK> terrible <UNK> <UNK> has succeeded in <UNK> <UNK> old Paris again , this time with a <UNK> ballet <UNK> called The <UNK> <UNK> , the story of a <UNK> <UNK> operator who falls <UNK> in love with a <UNK> steam <UNK> .
A <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of modern life , the piece has been set by <UNK> <UNK> to a <UNK> score ( a single <UNK> played over and over by four thousand French horns ) by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> , lovely <UNK> <UNK> plays the <UNK> <UNK> .
Ever since <UNK> , and , more recently , <UNK> Free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> , charming , and immensely <UNK> My Friend , the <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> in the modern style of a `` confession '' , <UNK> tells in <UNK> detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> .
It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs. <UNK> soon becomes <UNK> of <UNK> and , in <UNK> , <UNK> to continue to <UNK> the <UNK> off her glass .
Max , in a fit of despair , takes <UNK> and runs off for two marvelous weeks in <UNK> ( <UNK> calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which <UNK> <UNK> contracts <UNK> disease and dies .
This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are <UNK> with the major problems of our time .
Opera in the Grand <UNK> , along with <UNK> , seems to be <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> .
In this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , Felix <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> , a lean , <UNK> , <UNK> gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir <UNK> <UNK> , is responsible for the <UNK> of <UNK> earliest , most <UNK> opera , <UNK> , a <UNK> <UNK> with a haunting <UNK> that struck me as being highly <UNK> of the <UNK> version of `` <UNK> '' .
Miss <UNK> has a voice that Maria <UNK> once described as `` like <UNK> teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , <UNK> face becomes <UNK> <UNK> of the emotions demanded by the role of <UNK> .
The <UNK> <UNK> is literally <UNK> this summer with the <UNK> bodies of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> of all this <UNK> : <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ugly <UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> figure , who plays a <UNK> , <UNK> , philosophic <UNK> salesman in old <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film , A <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> has been <UNK> described as `` a symbol of the new <UNK> of France and myself '' ( De <UNK> ) and `` a <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> '' ! !
( Norman <UNK> ) , but no one can deny that the screen <UNK> with electricity whenever he is on it .
<UNK> to <UNK> along with him , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> Italian <UNK> , turns in a <UNK> performance as an airplane <UNK> .
The battle of the <UNK> continues , but most of New <UNK> knowing <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> their feet <UNK> in expectation of V ( for <UNK> ) Day , September first , when <UNK> <UNK> first <UNK> show opens at the <UNK> .
We have heard that after seeing Mr. <UNK> work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement .
And it is thought by many who think about such things that <UNK> is the logical <UNK> of a school that started with <UNK> , progressed through <UNK> and the <UNK> Picasso , and <UNK> just recently in <UNK> and De <UNK> .
<UNK> <UNK> his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' .
`` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to <UNK> <UNK> and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the <UNK> , <UNK> ' <UNK> ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in <UNK> '' .
It is his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The <UNK> of Cuba '' .
In this work , his use of <UNK> is startling and skillful .
The sweep of space , the delicate <UNK> of the white masses , the over-all <UNK> and unity , the <UNK> and imagination , all <UNK> it to be called an authentic masterpiece .
I asked <UNK> recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her <UNK> on the canvas '' , which was his typical <UNK> way of <UNK> me for my lack of sensitivity .
<UNK> <UNK> : Let me begin by clearing up any possible <UNK> in your minds , wherever you are .
The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither <UNK> nor <UNK> but an exact industrial term in use among professional <UNK> .
It is , I am <UNK> given to understand , the technical <UNK> for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; ;
i.e. , <UNK> who <UNK> while the tenants are absent , in contrast to <UNK> <UNK> , those who work while the occupants are home .
Since the latter obviously require an <UNK> you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am <UNK> you as socially <UNK> .
Far from it ; ;
I merely draw an <UNK> distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a <UNK> .
Above all , <UNK> yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your <UNK> my residence , to <UNK> over the loss of a few <UNK> <UNK> , or to shame you into <UNK> .
My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the <UNK> implications for you , far beyond the legal <UNK> society might <UNK> .
You have <UNK> set in motion forces so <UNK> , so <UNK> , that it would be downright <UNK> of me not to warn you about them .
Quite <UNK> , fellows , I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in China .
As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent <UNK> , permit me to <UNK> them briefly .
<UNK> on Saturday evening , August <UNK> , while my family and I were dining at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , in Rome , you <UNK> a window of our home in <UNK> County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the <UNK> .
<UNK> to the attic , the temperature of which was easily <UNK> than the <UNK> Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool <UNK> , some <UNK> pants , and the like , and to <UNK> the <UNK> boxes and <UNK> stored there .
What you were looking for ( unless you make a <UNK> of collecting old tennis <UNK> and fly screens ) <UNK> me , but to judge from <UNK> records scattered about a <UNK> <UNK> .
You danced two <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> , which must have been fairly <UNK> in that <UNK> .
You then <UNK> one story , <UNK> a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom .
From the <UNK> cabinet on its south wall and the <UNK> beneath , you <UNK> seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone <UNK> of Oriental and African origin , two <UNK> , and a <UNK> <UNK> glass .
<UNK> through a <UNK> of <UNK> nearby , you <UNK> an antique French <UNK> set in ivory and <UNK> , which , along with two box <UNK> , you added to your <UNK> .
Then , having wrapped the lot in an <UNK> my dog <UNK> slept on , you <UNK> out the front door , <UNK> leaving it open for neighbors to discover .
So much for the <UNK> facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the <UNK> and state <UNK> who followed in your wake .
The foregoing , aided by several clues I'll <UNK> to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a <UNK> worthy of Inspector <UNK> , but before they close in , <UNK> yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance <UNK> more <UNK> .
<UNK> of the <UNK> you took possess properties of a most curious and <UNK> nature , as you will observe when your <UNK> begin to <UNK> and your hair falls out in patches .
In time , these minor manifestations will <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> you with <UNK> , the <UNK> evil , sheep rot , and <UNK> <UNK> , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release .
All this , though , is simply a <UNK> , a <UNK> , for what <UNK> , and I doubt whether any <UNK> could accurately forecast it .
If , however , it would help to <UNK> your <UNK> , I can <UNK> the powers of a few of the <UNK> you've <UNK> and describe the punishment they <UNK> out in one <UNK> instance .
<UNK> on tight .
First of all , the six figures of the <UNK> you <UNK> -- four <UNK> heads , a black <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> position , and a large brass figure of the <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> base .
Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord <UNK> is the most <UNK> of the gods , much more so than <UNK> and <UNK> and the rest .
<UNK> up -- don't you ? ?
Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the <UNK> of the Law <UNK> ) toward <UNK> folk who <UNK> , disturb , or <UNK> the <UNK> .
Very peculiar <UNK> indeed seems to <UNK> such <UNK> .
Eight or ten years ago , a couple of French <UNK> stole a <UNK> <UNK> head from the <UNK> <UNK> , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the <UNK> with <UNK> symptoms of <UNK> .
<UNK> own amount of <UNK> oil did nothing to <UNK> their <UNK> ; ;
they <UNK> amid <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> the <UNK> One to forgive their <UNK> .
Any <UNK> French <UNK> can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I'll presently <UNK> a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our <UNK> .
Whether the pair of <UNK> ivory <UNK> you lifted really possess the <UNK> to turn your <UNK> to lead , as a dealer in <UNK> assured me , I am not competent to say .
<UNK> the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( <UNK> <UNK> ) ; ;
a friend of mine removing her from the <UNK> cabinet for inspection was <UNK> as if by a <UNK> , but he had previously drunk a quantity of <UNK> .
The three Indian brass <UNK> , though -- <UNK> , <UNK> , and <UNK> -- are an altogether different cup of tea .
They <UNK> from <UNK> , a state in the <UNK> where <UNK> , the <UNK> of death , is <UNK> .
Have you ever heard of <UNK> ? ?
<UNK> <UNK> .
But it is the wooden sculpture from <UNK> , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies <UNK> by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention .
<UNK> enough , this is an <UNK> against <UNK> , presented to the <UNK> and me by a local <UNK> in 1949 .
<UNK> around its base is a charm in <UNK> , a dialect I take it you don't <UNK> .
Neither do I , but the <UNK> <UNK> was good enough to translate , and I'll do as much for you .
<UNK> <UNK> our <UNK> , the legend states , can expect <UNK> sorrow .
The teeth will rain from his mouth like <UNK> , his wife will make him <UNK> with <UNK> , and a <UNK> car will grow in his stomach .
Furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> to throw away or <UNK> of their <UNK> .
The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the <UNK> generation .
<UNK> of <UNK> , isn't it ? ?
Still , there it is .
Now , you no doubt regard the preceding as <UNK> ; ;
you're <UNK> around full of <UNK> in your hot <UNK> , <UNK> yourselves on <UNK> and playing <UNK> in the <UNK> and generally <UNK> like <UNK> .
In that case , listen to what <UNK> another <UNK> who <UNK> with our <UNK> .
A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of <UNK> called a `` <UNK> turn '' .
In it was a stone <UNK> <UNK> I had picked up in <UNK> , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I <UNK> it with flowers or laid a few <UNK> in its lap .
After a while , we became aware that the money was <UNK> as fast as we <UNK> it .
Our <UNK> eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a <UNK> boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered <UNK> to the people overhead .
The more I <UNK> into this young man's activities and character , the less <UNK> I found him .
I learned , for example , that he made a practice of <UNK> at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of <UNK> salt on the icy pavement to <UNK> their feet .
His energy was <UNK> ; ;
sometimes he would be up before dawn , <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> to <UNK> us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx <UNK> to <UNK> at the <UNK> and press cigar <UNK> against their <UNK> .
<UNK> , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like <UNK> & <UNK> or Peter's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hats and singing `` O <UNK> <UNK> '' .
In short , and to borrow an <UNK> phrase , <UNK> timber .
Well , the <UNK> little <UNK> went along <UNK> animals and humans who couldn't <UNK> , and in due course , as was inevitable , <UNK> himself .
One morning , we discovered not only that the <UNK> were missing from the <UNK> but that a cigarette had been <UNK> out in its lap .
`` Now he's bought it '' , said my wife <UNK> .
`` No <UNK> will hold still for that .
He's really asking for it '' .
And how right she was .
The next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ;
he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of <UNK> , was <UNK> with <UNK> , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire .
Some sort of <UNK> was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a <UNK> voice -- either an <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , a <UNK> , we couldn't determine which .
His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. <UNK> <UNK> when he was found before his open safe wearing the <UNK> band .
The <UNK> the youth worked for soon tired of his <UNK> effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of <UNK> , and let him go .
The beautiful , the satisfying part of his <UNK> , however , was the <UNK> way the <UNK> polished him off .
<UNK> to <UNK> , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer .
His <UNK> , deficiency of taste , and <UNK> carried him <UNK> to the top .
He <UNK> programs that <UNK> new depths of <UNK> and <UNK> whole networks , and quickly <UNK> his boss .
Not long ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City ; ;
he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two <UNK> at once , clearly a man in <UNK> .
`` See that guy '' ? ?
The operator asked <UNK> .
`` I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in China .
There's some kind of a <UNK> haunting his footsteps '' .
However one looks at it , therefore , I'd say that your <UNK> for this autumn is the reverse of <UNK> .
The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move ; ;
you can't very well <UNK> up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot <UNK> .
<UNK> , since you're going to be <UNK> de combat pretty soon with <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> boil , the <UNK> <UNK> , liver <UNK> , <UNK> , and a host of other <UNK> of the <UNK> you've aroused , you <UNK> expect to be <UNK> socially .
My advice , if you live long enough to continue your <UNK> , is that the next time you're attracted by the <UNK> , pass it up -- it's nothing but a <UNK> .
As you can count on me to do the same .
<UNK> yours ,
S. J. <UNK>
<UNK> in the desert
the doors of the D train slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat and , <UNK> , looked up across the <UNK> , the whole <UNK> in my head burst into song .
She was a living doll and no mistake -- the <UNK> <UNK> , the wide <UNK> , <UNK> , that betrayed the <UNK> strain in her <UNK> <UNK> , and the mouth whose only fault , in the <UNK> <UNK> phrase , was that the lower lip was a trifle too <UNK> .
From what I was able to gauge in a swift , <UNK> glance , the figure inside the <UNK> <UNK> dress was <UNK> .
