I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off .
Mmmm , it sure itches '' .
`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' .
`` Oh , I'd love to '' .
I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .
That always relaxes me .
Doesn't it you '' ? ?
`` Only when I do it '' .
I shook my head .
One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .
`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce .
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .
So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone ''
I looked at my watch .
Ten after nine .
Time to go , I supposed .
`` Well , goodbye '' , I said .
`` Goodbye .
You'd better hurry '' .
`` Oh , you can count on that '' .
She smiled slightly .
Softly .
Warmly .
`` Don't hurry too much .
I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .
That was all she said .
But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .
However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think .
I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .
As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .
Hot water .
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .
Hell , she couldn't .
Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .
But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected .
Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .
Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .
I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .
Two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .
At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather .
A few yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra .
Lieutenant Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me .
`` How'd you hear about this one '' ? ?
I grinned , but ignored the question .
He didn't push it ; ;
Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years .
He filled me in .
A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now .
Present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been Thor's partner Bill Blake , and Antony Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account .
Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .
`` What were they doing here '' ? ?
I asked Rawlins .
`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff '' .
`` Yeah , I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately .
What is the gunk '' ? ?
`` How would I know ? ?
It's a secret .
That was the new advertising angle -- something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient .
Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' -- He stopped and looked at Thor's body .
I said , `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows .
How's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? ?
`` Can't say yet .
Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em .
The PM might show he drowned instead , but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us .
Accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' .
`` I'll pick murder .
Anything else '' ? ?
`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out .
Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ;
this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife .
If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ;
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .
I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter .
The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day .
The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .
I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .
I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there .
When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted .
The arrangement turned out to be excellent .
I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras .
I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ;
and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner .
The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .
It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with masks and go adventuring .
My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .
Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything .
One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .
They were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .
She looked more like twenty-five or six .
It was really a May and December combination .
My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex .
There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .
Her legs were the full , sexy kind , full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite ; ;
the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect .
You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .
The true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body .
The artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .
And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .
That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .
I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks .
True , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care .
She was standing with her back to the glass door .
Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .
As it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something clicks .
Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance .
When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it .
And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously .
I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .
I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .
When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of `` Me , too '' .
You have probably experienced this .
It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity .
Why she married him I do not know .
I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me .
He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living .
Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ;
some women with father fixations do .
For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; ;
his bride opened the store .
I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition .
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .
The cavernous depth , cluttered with antiques , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk .
She placed her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next '' ? ?
I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune .
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
I was standing beside her , watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped .
I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush .
Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender .
I heard her murmur , `` We'd better lock the door '' .
It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .
When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said :
`` He will not always be indisposed '' .
`` I know .
I was thinking about that .
How will we work it out '' ? ?
`` I don't know '' , she said .
`` You're the man .
You figure it out .
I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met '' .
`` I guess we both felt it '' .
I said .
`` I guess so '' , she said .
`` But now what '' ? ?
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable .
`` I know what we can do '' , I said .
`` Tell him I made a pass at you '' .
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .
`` What are you trying to do ? ?
Get thrown out ? ?
If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? ?
`` I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will .
I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us '' .
`` By telling him you are making passes at me '' ? ?
She said incredulously .
`` When I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class .
I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets .
In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; ;
and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us .
Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially .
A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball .
There will be romance and flirtation .
If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am .
We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain .
And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
You are both the same size .
He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask .
When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it '' .
`` But you '' -- she began .
`` Don't worry about me .
It will turn out all right '' .
`` I don't understand '' , she insisted .
`` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ?
`` No '' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education '' .
As we expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning .
I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife .
I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .
I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .
Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .
A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner .
I must say the figure was well made up .
If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him .
In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .
I suspected why he brought it along .
In the half darkness I approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me .
He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without wasting words I smacked him hard across the face .
`` You cheap bitch '' ! !
I exclaimed .
`` You cheap , no good , two-timing bitch ! !
You get a good , loyal husband -- smack ! !
-- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew ! !
You should -- smack ! !
-- be ashamed of yourself .
He had better write a postcard to Walter .
He opened the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips ) were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address .
The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer .
The code , which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use .
A card to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something .
Nicolas called on his muse , a line came back :
`` Squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts '' .
That ought to draw a laugh , Nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind .
And indeed , his postcard did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend , the poet Nicolas Manas , to his friend Meredith Wilder .
Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table .
Dammit ! !
He inwardly cried .
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned .
The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt .
His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months .
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
Now , he was just in the late poems of Holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next semester's class preparation .
He was determined to spend an industrious summer .
Well , maybe Manas wouldn't call .
Meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him : Sie lacheln , die Schwarzen Hexen .
The menace of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark fates laughed ' ? ?
Or , more rhythmically , ' The swarthy witches are laughing ' ? ?
And he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas .
But Nicolas , too , was being interrupted , that morning .
Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ;
but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him .
Should she wake him ? ?
She didn't have the heart .
Her heart , her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from Poussin .
She was just not able to break the spell .
( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars ? ?
Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?
So if all these beers was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' .
Ballet dancer : Protests , tears , and `` take what you want , Nicolas , I am a dancer , you are a poet , it is all beautiful '' .
To this meek conjugation Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket .
And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat '' .
And , as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew .
He had always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms .
He used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions .
Mary Jane Lerner knew none of this .
) Her Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes .
She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .
This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised .
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes .
His advice , his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair -- this was all new .
Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith .
The next day he was gone .
Mary Jane might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined .
Even so , it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts .
Packing a small suitcase , informing her husband whom she found in Harry's Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while , patting his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours .
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens .
`` Dear girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens '' .
`` How like him '' ! !
Mary Jane had smilingly said .
`` His address '' , Walter added , `` is that great foundling home , the American Express .
And I will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband .
'' For the last half hour Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the Gardens and , at last , come upon her knight .
His presence there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels .
She set down her suitcase .
Should she wake him ? ?
No .
Smiling , she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched .
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .
Nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car .
He began sweating .
In his dream he cried , `` Slow down , for Chrissake '' ! !
He half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass .
His nose was tickled .
He sneezed .
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers .
He spit .
He half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs .
He belched , he stretched .
Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away .
Twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the Grafin's pension , her tears dried , signing a hotel form and asking for a bath .
Mary Jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities .
She had retreated to this world .
The Grafin , who was charmed by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair .
Families are very interesting .
Nevertheless , there is no bath .
But a young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once .
And then we shall see .
'' ( The Grafin was partial to the word shall .
)
Meredith was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty ! !
Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?
Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe .
You shall see her at dinner '' .
Rather erotically he listened to the bath water running ; ;
when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way .
Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .
A thing he did not like doing , generally .
Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan .
He flexed his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed .
In the small gallery used as the guests' dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began teasing the young waitress .
He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the Grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table .
It would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he , oh , dropped his napkin , so startled was he by Mary Jane's beauty .
Yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here , indeed , was something special .
Mary Jane had made very little effort .
Above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with , as he soon perceived , no brassiere beneath .
Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders .
Perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day .
She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual .
The result was grace and modesty .
As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control .
Meredith began falling in love .
Soup : `` Only this morning '' ; ;
veal cutlets : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! !
; ;
Wine : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? ?
; ;
Fruit compote : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ;
a smile .
`` What a beautiful room .
Like as if it were built of books '' .
Having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin .
Opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it .
`` I think the maids tipple in the afternoon '' .
`` Those sweet girls ? ?
Oh you're joking .
It tastes a little like poppyseed .
What's its name ? ?
Steinhager '' She whispered Steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it .
`` Would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself '' ? ?
Meredith's voice was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ;
in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. , Poetry Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .
His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .
The husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite , Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ?
) But he read on .
In the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind '' .
Mary Jane took the page from him and began reading it , moving her lips with the words .
`` Oh , it's that myth , about Orpheus and What is her name ? ?
I can never pronounce it '' .
She repeated `` Eurydice '' .
The third time rather urgently .
But with her hand poem again .
She raised her face and nodded , `` It's sweet , and very sad '' .
They discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds .
They finished the small bottle of Steinhager .
She confessed she was unhappy , he asked was it her husband ? ?
She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please don't judge all poets '' .
They smiled .
At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' .
Kissing her he whispered , several times , `` Eurydice '' .
The third time rather urgently .
But with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , expectant , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth .
They were west of the Sabine , but only God knew where .
For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea .
Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ;
suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ;
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs .
And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze .
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .
`` Hoa-whup '' ! !
He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .
He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .
He spat .
The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton .
He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs .
The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches .
He cleared his throat and wet his lips .
As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink '' .
He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .
They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation .
The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste .
But it was water .
Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !
He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity .
He took a long but carefully controlled draught .
He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .
She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .
She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face .
She set the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .
`` What happens when there's no more water '' ? ?
She asked smolderingly .
She was like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive .
Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal .
Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .
And all the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly .
A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .
`` There must be some water under there '' .
He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .
`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .
`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?
She scoffed .
`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever , too '' ? ?
`` We can boil it '' , he said .
Her chin sharpened .
`` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely .
`` The tires are rattling on the wheels now .
They'll roll off in another day .
There was no valley like this on your map .
You don't even know where we're headed '' .
`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west .
Somewhere , we'll hit a trail '' .
`` Somewhere ! !
'' She repeated .
`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .
His wide mouth compressed .
In a way , he couldn't blame her .
He had picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon .
It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .
It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .
She had hated the whole idea before they started .
Actually , she had hated him before she ever saw him .
It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .
The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .
He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time .
But each mile westward , she had hated him the deeper .
He stared at the dipper , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands .
`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .
`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !
Her laugh was hard .
`` They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around '' .
He winced .
`` Hettie , they didn't sell you '' , he said miserably .
`` They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own .
They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them .
Without money or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge '' ? ?
`` I might have starved , but at least I wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! !
He darkened under his heavy burn .
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .
To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .
The valley lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead .
Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills .
He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina .
He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! !
And goaded the oxen as he yelled .
He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm .
Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .
He swung up over the wheel .
`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .
But she sat on in stubborn silence .
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .
Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones .
The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .
Their world turned black .
It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence .
The heavens opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts .
And then came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket .
Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods .
Through the splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks .
The jetting , frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff .
The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising .
They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .
The cloudburst cut off abruptly .
They were engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river .
Then the darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight .
Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills .
The water level was higher than their hubs .
Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .
There was no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere .
Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon .
Now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past .
The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling .
Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben .
Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit .
At least , the wheels dug in .
The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .
She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .
Somebody was riding the tree .
It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch .
She did not call out .
But as the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell .
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .
It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly .
The pale blob of the woman disappeared .
`` There's the one who's lucky '' ! !
The girl murmured harshly .
Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson .
Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his .
It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man .
He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water .
He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward .
They were already swollen to bursting .
Of all their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured .
It was spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it .
The oxen might as well enjoy it .
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .
The waters lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ;
there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding .
He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley .
A terrible , numbing sense of futility swept over him .
He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat .
Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen .
The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .
Hope surged within him .
He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate .
Still , he felt better .
A tight wagon meant so much .
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .
He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort .
Their jams and jellies had not suffered .
He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save .
Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie .
His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time .
He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .
He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures .
He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I don't figure your things got wet too much .
That's a good trunk .
If you want to get them aired ''
She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be streaked '' .
He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .
Sulphur , oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of .
I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze .
Now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do .
The lifeboats were stuck fast .
We couldn't budge them .
I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back .
He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .
One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits .
Brassnose yelled : `` Come on , Sommers , Max step on it , we got a chance now .
Heave on those ropes ; ;
the boat's come unstuck '' .
We pulled and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely .
The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .
Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water .
Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .
`` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair .
`` That tub is going to explode all at once '' .
Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke .
Dimly , we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno .
Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water .
`` Sommers , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded .
As best as I could determine , we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea , in the Bismark Archipelago .
Three days previously , we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance .
Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon .
There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ;
our muscles were hot wires of pain .
Brassnose was strangely silent .
The big man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago .
He then said something which struck a chord in my memory .
`` God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga .
We'd be in real trouble then .
I'd rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .
I was puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies .
He had been speaking of this archipelago :
`` Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 , , Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth .
The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century -- stone age amazons who live in an all-female , matriarchal society which is self-sufficient '' .
I remembered , too , the jesting voice of a classmate , Bobby Pauson : `` But how do they reproduce , Dr. Griggs ? ?
I'm sure that males have something to do with that process '' ! !
There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson .
Of course , males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga .
Indeed , you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods .
In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' .
`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said .
`` I know something about Eromonga .
Let's hope we come to a safer place '' .
But we didn't .
Three hours later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view .
Foster Lukuklu Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs : I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil .
A half-hour passed ; ;
we had drifted closer .
In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo'sun's mate quavered :
`` Tchalo ! !
It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff '' .
I squinted at the looming shoreline .
There was a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump ; ;
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs .
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .
`` What is the scaffolding for , Brassnose '' ? ?
He made a sound of despair deep in his throat .
It was embarrassing to see strapping , blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen .
`` Aaa-ee ! !
It is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death .
It is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there .
Often , I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul .
They had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers '' .
Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .
I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them .
But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .
So , I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said , `` We greet you in peace .
In ngandlu .
My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .
We are thirsty and hungry ; ;
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention '' .
The girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me .
I noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair .
She said , `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen .
You are welcome to Eromonga .
My people await you on the shore .
You shall have food , water and rest '' .
Thirty minutes later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder .
I saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there .
I looked .
All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight .
There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick .
Some had been there for years ; ;
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .
There was one object which sickened yet fascinated me .
This was also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face , the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose .
The body may have been two or three weeks' dead .
I looked with revulsion at the legs .
They were shattered .
Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh .
The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .
As if divining my thoughts , the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden :
`` This is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku .
Later , you shall know it better .
Is it not well-made ? ?
Our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago .
It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .
We are very proud of it '' .
`` You have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us .
He looked as if he was going to keel over .
I felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid .
Not so soon , anyway .
I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .
He speaks your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning .
The maku Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather '' .
This was the worst thing I could have said .
Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you're a fool ! !
They despise males who brag of their strength ; ;
they destroy such men with their damned tests .
You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !
At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this .
But a glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out .
The women's faces had hardened after my statement .
At a nod from Songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms .
The man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ;
but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .
Besides , terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will .
My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
.
In the Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed .
In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases .
Her name was L'Turu and she told me many things .
For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .
Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .
( Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951 .
)
From L'Turu , I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations .
But in the middle of the last century an island woman named `` Karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled .
Miraculously , Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes , after considerable loss of life on both sides .
Karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist .
She quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death .
Within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up .
`` Karipo was great goddess , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the crone told me .
`` All men went away from here .
Those who stayed had to pass tests .
Few passed '' .
She cackled with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth .
`` Karipo's women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here .
Come , I show you '' .
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .
In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground .
`` I guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home .
Maybe to beat up on his squaw '' .
Benson looked up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib .
Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack .
`` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' .
Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver .
For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened .
Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought .
Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us .
Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .
`` Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny '' ? ?
He said to his partner .
`` You mean dream '' ? ?
`` Not exactly .
Just see it '' .
Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .
`` Nope , just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner '' .
Ramey smiled but he thought to himself , I always see me too .
Never Benny .
Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind .
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .
With this realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down .
`` You seen him yet '' ? ?
Benson said , referring to the Indian .
`` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said .
`` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said .
`` If you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car '' .
`` Too long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke .
A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .
It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .
Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed .
All the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane .
Horsely , an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist .
It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .
The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .
He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer .
Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .
When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .
`` There's a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped .
She had driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that .
She wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt .
Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .
`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?
Benson said .
Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition .
She might have been someone he had once loved .
He had never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run .
The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .
How would you ever see her again ? ?
The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .
Their work was lonely .
`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?
Benson said , and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been .
The girl looked around at the countryside .
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .
It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .
She began to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly .
What had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was .
The girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , Ma'am '' .
The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .
The man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car .
The two drivers moved closer .
`` What does he want , a spoon '' ? ?
Benson said to Ramey .
One tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain .
With Ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember .
The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top .
The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .
He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .
He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .
He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .
`` He's dead , isn't he '' ? ?
The man said .
He turned and bent over the body of the Indian .
There was nothing in particular on the man's face .
It was simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine .
`` What's this '' ? ?
The man said , backing up a step , still looking down .
His words were mostly to himself .
`` Don't '' .
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice .
Ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement .
`` But what is it '' ? ?
The man said with a tone of impatience .
But what is it ? ?
The man had spoken only once .
Ramey heard the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears .
The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg .
Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .
He stared at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , fella .
Them's brains '' .
The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .
Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .
It was a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ;
he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin .
Ramey's fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together .
The man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement .
Ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand .
As he watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet .
He hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard .
With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .
His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open .
After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .
The man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth .
He moaned and pulled the hand away .
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .
Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .
He did not look around .
`` What happened '' ? ?
Someone said .
`` He's hurt '' ! !
A woman's voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife .
The man on the ground began to move ; ;
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him .
Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .
The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back .
`` Can you hear , can you talk to me '' ? ?
She begged .
An incoherent , puzzled sound came from the red mouth .
The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .
`` Why did you do it -- why did you hit him '' ? ?
She said , her voice rising .
Ramey said nothing .
A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .
Behind Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers .
No one seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out .
Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .
Benson moved his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly .
Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man .
Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .
It's all over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them .
Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .
He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol .
`` All right , step back '' ! !
The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .
He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .
`` You all right '' ? ?
`` Mough -- it's my mough '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips .
His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .
Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .
The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .
He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .
He heard their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes .
It was only then that he turned to look at Penny .
She was sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her .
The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .
But her hands were calm , now .
She's got guts , thought Keith .
She's got more guts than any other woman in the world .
`` Keith '' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful .
I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .
Thank you , Keith '' .
He smiled at her sincerity .
And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .
Strange .
Seven years they'd been married .
He knew her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part .
But her beauty always surprised him anew .
`` I realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith .
`` But knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to .
Isn't that so '' ? ?
Penny lowered her eyes .
`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .
`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?
Asked Keith , his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger .
`` It was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it ? ?
didn't it ? ?
''
Penny did not answer .
Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .
`` We're all God's creatures , aren't we '' ? ?
Keith was snarling now .
`` All of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle .
You love this village and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures , too .
And you love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he's a beautiful man .
And he loves you because you're a beautiful woman .
We're all God's creatures , aren't we , Penny ? ?
All of us , that is , except me .
You hate me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt .
You actually hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake .
Well , why don't you say something '' ? ?
Penny would not rise to his mood .
`` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?
She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .
He knew she was not sulking , not even angry at him .
Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him .
The Brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet .
For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .
Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space .
But Keith looked down more than up .
He thought of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords .
At first it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war .
But `` after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself .
Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .
And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .
He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .
The RAF was Britain's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war .
He knew how to shoot down Nazis .
And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear .
That was true , but only half the truth .
The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself .
He enjoyed the killing .
Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .
He enjoyed killing .
And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi .
Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .
The Nazis bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down .
Not quite .
It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .
It took a long time before the British tipped the balance .
Keith learned too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked .
They grounded him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices .
That was where he met Penny .
He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all .
Penny knew him better , on her part .
He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .
They don't go for bull-like muscle , as a rule .
He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .
He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .
His hair was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man .
The pretty little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied .
Keith was an eagle .
Penny and Keith had no romance .
No dates or hand-holding .
But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .
The Command offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy .
The Nazis knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit .
This time , they had been lucky .
The Command post was underground , and well camouflaged .
But there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps .
There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .
This one was actually more of a `` near miss '' .
The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself .
There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .
That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .
They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .
Keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much .
The bomb was a solitary one .
The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .
Keith's eyes met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .
And , as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his .
The chaplain married them , on the next day .
After the war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her .
She came from Ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers .
But to Keith's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible .
It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .
Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .
He stressed the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles .
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .
He couldn't stop killing .
That was his true love , not Penny .
The terrible power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose .
And in the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing .
When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .
This is a paradise for hunters .
This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .
The great black leopards .
The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .
He even hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin .
But there are big rogues in both countries .
These were the ones Keith sought out -- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself .
He and Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah .
And while he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing .
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools .
Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .
There were fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song .
Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .
Wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the .
Now , the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; ;
and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface .
He and his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together .
The German courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first .
Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .
He was frowning .
He took his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck .
`` Temper , temper '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .
A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten A.M.
`` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .
`` All I have to do to set the record is to go on down .
So instead I come up '' .
`` Was it my equipment '' ? ?
The German asked .
`` Was it something went bad with the breathing '' ? ?
`` The equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up .
He was a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation .
He stared stonily at the floor .
`` I was down to 275 .
I've been that far half a dozen times .
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick '' .
`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder .
`` You are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record .
And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .
So you turn around '' .
`` No , it wasn't that '' , Rob said .
A note of awe came into his voice .
`` When I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down .
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .
`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .
`` That's right '' , Robinson said .
`` I was expecting it , sure .
But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .
You don't head back down again .
Not me , anyway .
Not right away '' .
He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .
Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .
Now he was going to show how much he knew .
`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir .
He ran into the rapture of the depths .
Nitrogen narcosis .
It makes the diver feel drunk '' .
`` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .
`` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said .
`` Anyway '' , Waddell went on .
`` It's nothing to fool with .
It can kill you .
Personally , I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story '' .
`` Nobody's giving anything up '' , Robinson said .
He stood there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ;
and yet like a child among adults .
`` You think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride ? ?
I'm going down again '' .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
Mr. Forsythe exclaimed .
`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that '' .
He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .
He went to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony .
Old Commodore Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first .
Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .
`` Why '' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it .
I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop .
Hell , I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob '' ? ?
`` Seven years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively .
He was thinking , big deal : skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started .
`` Excuse me '' , he said abruptly .
He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ;
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him .
`` When you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said .
Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge .
He was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley .
`` Hi there , Schaffner '' , he had said .
`` Can I make you one '' ? ?
`` No thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English .
`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .
Waddell had looked the man over , trying to size him up .
He was in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways .
His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .
Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night .
Aloud he had said , making conversation :
`` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .
`` Yes '' , Herr Schaffner had said .
`` He's one hell of a decent boy .
I like that kid '' .
`` I agree , yes '' .
`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?
`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .
Waddell turned to face him .
`` No '' ? ?
He asked .
`` But that's what he told me .
Why , that's his main reason for making the dive '' .
Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
Waddell asked , frowning .
`` Please let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit .
`` I have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year .
Now I wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong .
I must have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products .
With all respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries '' .
Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .
`` Did you tell him all this '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Perhaps not in so many words '' , the German said .
`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .
Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .
We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;
of course , I was willing .
But there was no definite agreement about business arrangements '' .
`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said .
There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .
He started out the door .
`` One moment '' ! !
Herr Schaffner said .
`` You intend to speak with Mr. Roy '' ? ?
`` What else '' ? ?
Waddell asked .
`` If you will pardon , I think it would be better if not .
Mr. Roy is determined to make this dive .
Whatever you tell him he will dive .
I know this from my talks with him '' .
`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ?
Waddell said .
`` On the basis of the facts '' .
`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .
`` At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .
It is not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm '' .
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .
`` I am an honest man '' , the German said with fervor .
`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .
I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .
All tourists come to Florida .
This will help him to get out of his little tackle shop .
Yes ! !
But there is no use causing him to worry at this time '' .
The German's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty .
He took a big swig of his drink .
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this .
`` I think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said .
`` He has the distributorship for Florida , you say '' ? ?
`` Yes '' , the German said .
`` At least for South Florida '' .
`` By God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times .
I guess you're right '' .
He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .
The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ;
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America .
`` Join me in another '' ? ?
He had asked .
`` Thank you '' , the German had said courteously .
`` I do not drink so much '' .
Now , in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk .
Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .
He pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper .
`` Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;
crossed himself ; ;
said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding .
Folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters .
`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .
Make it come off all right .
Let me set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive .
And make my life different and better from this time on .
Amen '' .
He crossed himself again and rose .
He felt a good deal less shaky .
As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk .
Artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger .
He waited awhile before he said , `` Roy , you know your decompression table , don't you '' ? ?
`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .
`` You came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , Artie said .
`` Well , I was a little bit confused .
Anyway , I wasn't down long enough to matter .
You don't see me stretched out on the deck , do you '' ? ?
`` You know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .
`` I don't think you should go down again '' .
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .
As his feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand .
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed .
In the leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .
He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .
His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure .
Yesterday ; ;
today ; ;
tomorrow : no surrender .
His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt .
He murmured to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender '' .
It was best to die fighting the marines .
His superiors had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor .
What if the marines never came ? ?
His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .
Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .
Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .
He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .
The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .
Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth .
As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing .
Gloom receded .
The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight .
His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist .
`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .
A signal ? ?
Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .
Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .
They had fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out .
Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .
A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .
The marines let him advance .
When he sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy .
Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun .
The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies .
Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea .
At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death .
Apprehensively he peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze .
He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him .
He strained his hearing .
Cautious feet stepping on leafmold ; ;
faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;
whispers : he heard none of these .
Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .
Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .
A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;
leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it .
Humiliation made Matsuo tremble .
While his comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver .
Taking aim at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .
He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound .
Hush followed .
Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle .
How stupid to give his position away .
The jungle did not retort .
The sitter remained seated hugging the tree .
Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called .
Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .
Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .
He went into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail .
It ended when he tumbled ; ;
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .
He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .
With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .
When he got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face .
The pockets of his jacket bulged .
Hand grenades .
The bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .
The marine spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward .
In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .
They could come on him now without difficulty .
Gradually he reached a conclusion .
The marine was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree .
Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage .
The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended .
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out .
Reflex ? ?
Rifle leveled on the man , he made a rush .
Heat , in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd .
He squatted by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground .
With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back .
He was bearded .
The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ;
around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch .
Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .
In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding .
In the other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief .
One by one he tossed the objects aside .
He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ;
he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running .
Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
Too bad the marine had no water .
From its holder he took his own canteen .
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure .
The marine's eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare .
So , alive .
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
The marine reached up a hand .
Matsuo shook his head .
`` None for you '' .
The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .
Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .
`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Some odor made him lean over the man .
He sniffed and recognized it .
Sake .
So that had been his difficulty .
Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .
The marine tried to roll on his right side , and moaned .
When he rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over .
`` Be a good turtle '' .
Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle .
The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts .
In the caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake .
The marine shut his eyes .
`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?
Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows .
He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .
Every so often he turned the knife .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .
The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping .
Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film .
The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes .
Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle .
He must have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze .
Matsuo shook his head .
Strange .
At last he reached for the knife .
Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it .
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .
The marine yelled and flung the hand away .
With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek .
A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist .
Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;
burned the other cheek ; ;
burned each hand when they came groping again .
The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .
Matsuo stood up .
`` A small measure of payment , marine '' .
He dropped the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder .
The marine , hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach .
He ceased weeping .
Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .
The marine was still .
He would soon die .
As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow .
What now ? ?
In the jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living .
Someone called .
It was the marine : head lifted , he strained and called .
Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat .
He cupped his mouth and yelled .
Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die .
He aimed , but listened .
It sounded as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese '' .
The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container .
He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .
`` Sake '' ? ?
Matsuo called .
The marine nodded vigorously .
Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .
The marine was a winehead .
His superiors had said that all marines were depraved .
The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .
Remembering his own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle .
One swallow was all he would have ; ;
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .
His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline .
He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .
Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .
Of course it was water he really craved ; ;
down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .
The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack .
Matsuo shook his head .
He had no water for an enemy .
And when this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool .
He capped the bottle and replaced it .
After all , he had less reason to desire it than the marine .
Before much longer the marine quieted down .
His head slumped .
The upper part of his packet had stained dark .
`` Marine .
There is nothing for you '' , Matsuo said .
`` Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it .
I've nothing for you '' .
From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping .
He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China .
In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame .
He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed .
`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that '' .
He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .
`` Stay right here where you are , kid '' , he called .
`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' :
The stranger ignored him .
He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .
`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
`` And what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy '' ? ?
`` Because I'm asking .
Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
Blue Throat winked at his six cronies .
`` The kid has no manners , boys .
Shall we teach him some '' ? ?
His gun was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster .
Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .
His head snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling .
Tilghman leapt on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar .
A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting .
Tilghman flung himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun .
The Colt roared twice and two men dropped , writhing .
A third shot doused the light .
Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy '' ? ?
`` Yes , George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet .
And I aim to have it '' .
He fired again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed .
Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .
`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' .
`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .
Somebody brought a light .
Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .
`` And now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said .
I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .
Blue Throat , nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight .
`` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .
Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .
The prediction was correct .
The Reverend James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance .
`` Amen '' , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere '' .
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .
Blue Throat , who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship .
It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .
He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn .
Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .
The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store , halfway down the street .
Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .
He sized up the situation and shook his head .
`` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said .
`` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' .
He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .
Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite .
`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' .
He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .
Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back .
Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .
All he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through .
Billy Tilghman did just that .
Within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside .
It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie .
Though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts .
To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet .
Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders .
He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .
He saw the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him .
For fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West .
The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung .
Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .
He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's .
Led by Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns .
Bill Doolin's ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him .
Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .
Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort .
On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch .
It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
The only evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke .
The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
`` Wait here , Neal '' , said Tilghman .
`` If I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse '' .
Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .
There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside .
Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day .
Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .
`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman .
The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move .
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .
Suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck .
Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .
And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman .
The fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide .
Thinking fast , Tilghman never hesitated for one instant .
He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him .
The men behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer .
`` Cold day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire .
`` Just dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives .
Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow '' .
The rancher was trembling .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .
`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely .
`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .
Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body .
One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .
`` Well '' , he announced , `` Guess I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup '' .
He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .
He left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive .
But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .
Leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown .
`` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly .
`` Just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry .
That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .
Even as he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread .
Back in the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then .
`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .
`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .
We'll let him go '' .
But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .
Wiley Lynn , a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since .
That night he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver .
For several months now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman .
This Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ;
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .
When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house .
Sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him .
He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .
But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .
And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure .
He could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ;
when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .
When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .
Miss Langford ( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl .
Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .
Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ;
but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack .
She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .
School began in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another .
The first two or three days they went home early .
All , that is , except Jack .
He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .
Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .
He thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating .
About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him .
He jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school .
He didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ;
then he slowed to a walk .
The vision became even stronger now .
`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .
`` I've got to get her '' .
That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .
He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .
`` What's the matter , honey '' ? ?
She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .
`` Aren't you hungry '' ? ?
`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .
Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen .
He felt a little sick at his stomach .
`` Are you sick '' ? ?
`` No '' , he said .
`` I'll be all right .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .
`` Don't you play hard today then .
And if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early .
Daddy left the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon '' .
`` OK. , I won't play hard '' , he promised .
Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder .
`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?
Charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth .
Charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes .
He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .
`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?
Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .
Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles' only apparent interest .
But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .
`` No .
What '' ? ?
`` I got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' .
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .
His heart beat faster .
`` Hell you say '' ? ?
He said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles .
`` How'd you do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I jist got on top of -- ''
`` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , I jist ask her '' .
`` Jist like that '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes .
She's been hangin' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well's try it .
Besides I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it '' .
`` I never heard that '' .
`` It's all over Branchville .
If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself '' .
`` I might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford .
When they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse .
Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .
`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .
`` Let's go inside '' .
`` Oh , come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .
`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .
`` Maybe at dinner time .
Come inside now '' .
The children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse .
Jack watched Miss Langford all morning .
He could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider .
Occasionally he would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did .
At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .
`` Why ain't you playin' ball '' ? ?
He asked Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .
`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .
`` I'd druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .
`` Maybe '' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford .
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` Goody , goody '' .
`` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .
`` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .
While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I'm sorry , Miss Langford .
I didn't mean to pull so hard '' .
`` That's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .
`` It was my fault '' .
With one hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other .
When her hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet .
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .
`` Thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off .
`` Will you play with us again , Miss Langford '' ? ?
One of the little girls said .
`` No more today .
Maybe some other day '' .
`` Oh , shucks '' , the girl said .
`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .
`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .
Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes .
When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .
He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .
That should do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work .
He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .
The only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack .
`` But I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately .
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly .
`` All right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .
`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .
And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .
He scarcely saw them .
His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it ? ?
On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise .
She munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck .
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .
Lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family .
The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier .
It is almost time for and calinda to begin '' .
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners .
He chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start .
The slaves ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name .
Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .
He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .
The drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds .
The dance was of Haitian origin .
The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .
He was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners .
He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names .
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .
She was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses .
Although New Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil .
Madame Lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders .
The slender , handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves .
He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race .
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John .
Shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses .
This young slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near .
The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .
`` What is your name , boy ? ?
Come a bit closer .
I won't bite , you know '' .
He gaped at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her .
Then he smiled shyly .
`` My name is Dandy Brandon , missy .
I belong to Master Alexander Prieur '' .
She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms .
You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' .
Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .
Lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm .
The woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor .
Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees .
Satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver .
This was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows .
`` Aristide ! !
I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .
There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack .
If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .
Prieur has gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings .
Besides , he owns 300 slaves .
One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
Aristide Devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat .
His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
`` Another youth , Madame '' ? ?
The coachman said softly .
`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?
Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .
`` Be quiet , Devol ! !
You are forgetting your place '' .
The tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur .
Delphine Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion .
Dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle .
He saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head .
Dr. Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses .
He was about 50 years old .
`` Another young man , my dear ? ?
Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure .
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .
`` Dandy is to be our house guest , Louis .
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .
He deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation '' .
`` Quite so , my dear .
His room will be ready shortly '' .
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .
Had Dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life .
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .
Besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth .
Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .
So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home .
Airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John .
He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .
It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell .
When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket .
Just six weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited .
A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics .
Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase .
It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .
The lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts .
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
Feebly he pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman ! !
You did this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home '' .
These were the last words he ever uttered .
Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .
Dr. Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead .
The ball broke up in confusion .
Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures .
Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .
But at the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story .
`` I saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him .
It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest .
After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .
How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say .
Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .
She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy ! !
He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .
Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .
Such a pitiful end '' ! !
Though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded .
The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady .
Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives .
So the verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold .
Once again life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners .
The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .
Then , on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip .
Mrs. Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .
The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .
The girl was not more than 16 .
She was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back .
The bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ;
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .
The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !
`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! !
Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .
`` There ain't nothin' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say .
`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man ! !
There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' .
He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .
Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .
Ever since all that .
It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .
He was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .
Out and out and never to return again .
Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .
That was the day it ended .
The freight car was cold , early in the morning .
He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .
The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ;
at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop's music pfffted away .
`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .
A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .
Hot , that was the word , hot ! !
Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings , with the sun shining down over them .
A poet , yet ! !
His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .
Zingggg-O ! !
Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .
He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .
Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished .
`` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said .
`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .
`` Ah-ah '' ! !
Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .
`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .
They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .
He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .
`` That crap is softer over here '' .
The girl smiled , and started forward .
The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .
`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .
`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .
We don't know this guy '' .
`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .
This guy was strictly from Outsville .
But nowhere ! !
`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?
Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall .
`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said .
His head came up and he said it defiantly .
`` Well , congratulations '' .
Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .
These two were going to be easy pickins .
They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .
And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn't have .
That was gonna be fun collecting ! !
But not just yet .
Feathertop was a connoisseur .
He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .
`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .
`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' .
He grinned at them wolfishly .
`` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused .
`` And you know -- you're right '' ! !
Feathertop aimed a finger at him .
`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided .
`` He's okay .
He's a nice guy '' .
She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .
Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .
He cleared his throat ; ;
it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance .
He had it all doped , of course .
Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll .
Hmm -- diddle ! !
`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?
Kitty inquired politely .
`` Where from '' ? ?
He mused .
`` Out .
I been riding train for a ways now '' .
They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .
After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' .
`` What's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ? ?
Ernie found it immensely funny .
The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .
`` No ! !
Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! !
She snapped at him .
`` I only said I was hungry .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .
Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .
`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers ! !
Why , we got dinner right here .
C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' .
Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .
He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .
`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .
`` Fan it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .
`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ? ?
Charcoal '' ? ?
`` Fella '' , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin' patience '' .
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .
`` Hot dogs , man .
Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .
He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .
Almost immediately they began to sizzle .
He looked up and grinned .
`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained .
`` I self-served '' .
When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .
Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .
`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ?
Ernie asked .
Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .
But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father .
He didn't want us to get married .
So we ran away '' .
`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ?
This time even she did not answer .
She looked down at her hands , too .
After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy .
It was my fault '' .
Cappy's head came around sharply .
`` Your fault , hell ! !
It was all my fault .
If I'd been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .
Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' .
Cappy raged at himself .
`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !
You never heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know '' ? ?
Ernie nodded .
This was a slightly different matter .
He remembered Midge , and the child .
But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .
A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .
But these kids weren't like him .
Oh crap ! !
He thought , Pull out of it , old son .
These are just another couple of characters to roll .
What they got , you get .
Now forget all this other .
`` Wanna drink '' ? ?
Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .
`` Yeah .
Now that you offer '' .
The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .
Ernie stared at the man .
He was big .
Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .
Road gang , Ernie thought .
`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ? ?
The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .
Ernie hesitated a moment .
This character could break him in half .
`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .
He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .
The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .
He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .
He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .
He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .
`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .
`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .
`` We're going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .
`` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .
He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .
`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' .
He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .
Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me ! !
The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .
Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .
The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! !
And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .
They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .
The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .
The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` Aaawww '' ! !
Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .
He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .
The blade came out with a snick ! !
He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .
She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him ! !
Help him ! !
Do something '' ! !
They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man .
To them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets .
The Old Man was unimportant .
Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ;
or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour -- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .
Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .
Or the bay of female dogs in heat .
They never called him by name , although he had one .
Filippo Rossi , that's what he was called in the old country ; ;
but here he was just Signore or the Old Man .
But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .
Youth obeyed when commanded .
It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .
But youth asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing .
The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .
But the past was dead here as the present was dead .
Once the Old Man had had a wife .
And once she , too , ignored him .
With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop .
In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase .
The way she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both .
Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back .
`` But she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said .
`` No , no .
Not that one .
She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino '' .
`` Eh , Torino ! !
She gave herself fancy airs ! !
Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours '' .
They had slapped their thighs .
`` It's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' .
`` Henh '' ! !
Calloused fingers , caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away .
Mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .
`` Puttana '' ! !
But if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig .
It was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed -- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner .
His voice had not commanded her to stop .
It had not questioned why .
The women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ;
but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him .
( He was never without that dog .
) And his eyes -- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction .
The Old Man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it .
Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .
But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? ?
There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him .
For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia .
It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .
What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals ? ?
Or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill ? ?
This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .
To him they were one and the same .
Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .
Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .
It slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches .
It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .
Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it .
And the coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window .
The hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it .
Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .
It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade .
That was Bartoli's shop .
Above it , from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood .
Did the Old Man remember them there ? ?
Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks -- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery .
Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .
Love and hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines .
And the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch .
The Old Man silently fed upon these streets .
They kept him alive , waiting .
Waiting for what and for whom , only he could tell and would not .
It was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price .
He was holding out for something .
He was determined to hold out .
The Old Man's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .
At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ;
neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him .
He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn't have cared less about that either .
To him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep .
When he would be a man , he would be a rich man .
He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .
He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .
He would not carry a brief case .
Nor would he work at all .
He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .
He would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service '' .
He would order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his gloves -- and light and smoke .
He could do that when he would be a man .
`` Hey , Laura '' ! !
He called to his sister on the porch above the steps .
She was only ten months older than he .
`` Laura , what would you say if I smoked a pipe '' ? ?
Laura did not answer him .
She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun .
One lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales .
Her tanned foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white .
All the while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest .
Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii .
It was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours .
The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .
Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .
He was never sure they fully took him in .
Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! !
But the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it .
`` She's in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood '' .
Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ?
And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .
Not even Laura .
Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him .
Above the tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him .
`` Christ sake , goat , git '' ! !
But the goat would not .
`` You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ?
Soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .
Pompeii rolled over .
His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .
With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .
The boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .
Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .
Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane .
But the boy could see only the goat's belly .
The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .
He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back .
There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .
Time enough to give up his soul .
In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii's shaved hair , edged up close to him .
The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .
He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta's idiot brother .
Pompeii expected Romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .
He expected Concetta's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything .
People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it .
The room filled with smoke , and Maggie's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to quench it .
Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery .
In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head .
She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ;
she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her .
She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .
Maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ;
there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating .
Worry had a great deal to do with it ; ;
Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .
Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .
Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .
In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? ?
`` It seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said .
She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .
`` I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said .
`` It would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman's Exchange isn't taking baked goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery '' .
`` I should think so '' , Eugenia said .
`` For one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day '' .
`` She's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice '' .
Maggie said .
She picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .
`` She'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed '' , Eugenia said .
`` Evadna Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old '' .
`` Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans '' .
`` Well now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said .
`` I'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' .
`` I'm sorry .
I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' .
`` Well , let's see .
Let's make a list of your assets '' .
Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining .
When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .
`` I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said .
`` We could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that '' .
`` What else '' ? ?
`` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
`` Every woman in the block has tried that '' .
`` What about a tea room , then ? ?
You could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes '' .
`` It's too elaborate .
And Grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I '' .
Eugenia sighed .
She said , `` Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' .
`` Oh , I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said .
`` But it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' .
`` Don't worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could .
Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it .
`` And then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time .
And I can go back to my contests and be thinking while I'm doing the washing '' .
`` What are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything '' ? ?
Maggie laughed .
She said , `` Oh Eugenia , I wish ''
`` What '' ? ?
`` I wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said .
`` All of them for you '' .
It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people .
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .
The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ;
it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources .
The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies .
There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ;
there never had been a need felt for such facilities .
That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .
The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ;
and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .
The government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything .
Shivering , people talked and argued ; ;
all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done .
Something had to be done ; ;
it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government .
Something had to be done .
The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day .
Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ;
about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .
Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .
The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold .
Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof .
Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma's room .
It was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive .
The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .
They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ;
they moved Maggie's bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds .
Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .
`` You said a mouthful '' , Eugenia said grimly .
Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin .
She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .
`` Plenty of people are poor all their lives '' .
`` Plenty of people haven't our brains and talent '' .
`` I know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said .
`` You're working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression '' .
`` The only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said .
They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way .
She didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater .
Hope wouldn't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire .
She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it .
Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .
`` Thrifty of her to use it up .
Unusual in a case like this , but '' --
`` You can joke ! !
Didn't you read it ? ?
She's married that tenant ! !
''
`` I read it , yes .
This ought to simplify Tolley's life '' .
Laban had more to say .
Tolley had gone to live in California .
He'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy Robards .
`` It was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it , Mamma .
Zion stayed to get my pin , but it'll be a cold day in June when I go back '' .
`` We will both go back , Laban '' ! !
Kizzie turned to go inside .
`` Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .
The sun's right '' --
`` Pictures '' ? ?
She swung around .
`` What pictures '' ? ?
`` In Brace's room ! !
You told me to bring my camera .
I'm not going back '' --
`` Indeed you are ! !
Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ? ?
Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny ! !
This -- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going to see that everybody at Mt. Pleasant understands that simple fact .
Wait for me , Laban , I'll be dressed in half a second '' ! !
Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back .
`` Hurry , Frank ! !
They're not going to laugh at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long ! !
Tolley's going is my fault .
I drove him away .
You know it and I'll tell everybody exactly how it happened '' .
She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .
He kissed her .
`` Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation '' .
`` I'll decide that when I get there .
I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair .
But I'll be fair now ! !
He is coming back , isn't he , Frank '' ? ?
Yes , oh yes .
What else was there to say ? ?
Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips :
`` Under the window in stormy weather
I marry this man and woman together .
Let none but Him who rules the thunder
Put this man and woman asunder '' .
Absolution for his lie ? ?
He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .
If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .
In any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own .
It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing .
`` You've told God , Frank '' , he said .
`` Why lacerate the -- congregation '' ? ?
Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .
Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .
`` ' And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit ' '' .
A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did .
But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .
Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal life .
There lay Grand Fair's Quinzaine , his own young parents' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .
He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made so often .
`` To absent loved ones '' .
But this last time he drank not to Brace but `` To Tolley '' ! !
Mr. Robards -- Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood who called him that -- was kind but too easygoing .
It didn't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , `` Howdy , Miss Jenny '' , adding a careless `` Roy '' , but it did her .
He could put a stop to it , she told him again and again .
Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank .
Mr. Robards laughed , said he'd feel a damn fool , plain-out couldn't do that even to please her .
`` You could try .
And if I ever hear you say ' Mist Laban ' again I'll scream .
And don't tell me you didn't at church Sunday .
I heard you '' ! !
He really hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards .
How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways .
Another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley's .
Her horse , rather .
But Mr. Robards' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes ! !
He called her `` the Mare '' much as Mrs. Whipsnade spoke of `` the Queen , God bless her '' .
He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of `` the Mare '' , `` the Racin' Mare '' , the revolting Gunny .
For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall .
And what had happened ? ?
Gunny invariably tried to bite her .
Nerves , Mr. Robards said , just a nip anyway .
`` Stand back , Miss Jen , she's oneasy of your scarf '' .
Never , `` Quit that , you sor'l devil '' ! !
Never concern for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January .
She musn't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too ! !
Listening for hours to his laments that the war and `` Mist Fair's '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it .
Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .
Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards .
Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested .
Jenny's aversion to having Dr. Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .
The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .
He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian ! !
Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house .
Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .
Jenny wished now that she had had Dr. Dunne , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets .
There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day , Miss Jen , hon .
Rhyme 'em up cute -- Arcilla , Flotilla ''
Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and --
`` Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie '' , he suggested .
`` She was mighty good to you past times , an' this'll fetch her '' .
Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .
Just wait till she saw the Mare's foal .
Handsomest colt in all Kentucky .
Strong too , up on his legs when he was an hour old .
What about Royal Robards ? ?
`` Why don't you name him Jesus Christ ! !
'' She burst into tears .
Roy was deeply distressed .
He'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been .
Of course she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it .
He had a good idea why not .
Those elegant `` At Home '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , hadn't brought many callers in two whole months .
Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come .
So had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer .
There was an idea .
Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round .
Oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips .
But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .
More and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie's and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .
Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too .
It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children .
She hoped they were well .
He didn't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .
If he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame .
`` Have a party an' leave 'em out , hon '' , he suggested .
`` A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them -- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .
We'll have oystchers -- couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time .
I'll see word gets round '' .
`` Don't you dare ! !
''
Miss Jen was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and perk up .
He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try .
Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .
Roy smiled -- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he'd give her a lift to Quinzaine .
Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .
`` See for yourself , Miss Zion .
It won't take a minute '' .
He swung in through his own wide gateway .
`` Them's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome .
She'll relish the sight of a friendly face .
Miss Kiz won't care your comin' , will she '' ? ?
`` Why of course not '' , Zion said uncomfortably .
`` He must have forgiven me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room .
The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; ;
Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .
She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .
Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .
Henrietta thought , It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .
There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .
Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .
Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .
In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; ;
there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ;
there had been the dancing class -- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .
There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .
Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .
It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know .
Mama was vulnerable ; ;
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .
But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her .
Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .
She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .
If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ? ?
Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .
No temptation , no sin .
No temptation , no virtue ? ?
A curious thought to end a curious night .
The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .
Before anything else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden .
Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .
She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .
It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .
After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .
Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .
On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .
It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .
Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .
Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .
Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .
The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .
Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .
`` Rummaging in the dew '' , said Rosa coldly .
`` Go change your shoes before you turn around '' .
She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .
Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .
To a Blackwell , there was only one church .
The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .
For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .
She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .
Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .
An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .
On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .
He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .
He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .
`` Summer's been slow to come '' , he said .
`` It's my dryin' out time '' .
He scowled at her flowers .
`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .
`` They'll be takin' me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so soon's they plan .
See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .
It's dryin' myself out that does it '' .
He regarded her with rising hope .
`` You'd like to hear how I go about it '' .
`` It's nice of you '' , Henrietta said doubtfully .
`` Y're welcome '' .
He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .
His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .
`` Every month , f'r three days '' , he said happily , `` I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .
It rests the tissues '' .
Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .
`` Rests the tissues '' , he said , `` and pacifies the system .
My dad did it , and he lived to a great age '' .
He looked up at her sharply .
`` Don't remember , do you '' ? ?
She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .
Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .
He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .
It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .
She said gently , `` Of course I remember you '' .
`` Not so well's I remember you '' , he said .
`` Y're the young Blackwell woman .
Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .
I know all about you '' .
`` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed .
`` Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully .
`` Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .
Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .
Any harm in that '' ? ?
`` Probably '' , said Henrietta dryly .
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .
`` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws .
Only , this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's open censure .
Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .
She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .
She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .
She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .
`` You've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad '' .
`` Y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast '' , he said .
`` Milk and sops '' ! !
He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .
`` He's lowly today '' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .
`` He's got this idea about drying out ''
`` It ain't an idea '' ! !
`` If it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? ?
He looked piously to heaven and said , `` Beer don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .
His grand-daughter sighed .
`` Come on , do .
The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell's on her way somewheres '' .
`` To the graveyard .
Who ain't '' ? ?
`` Not me .
I've got a day's work to do .
-- You'll be visiting Miss Doaty , Ma'am '' ? ?
Henrietta nodded .
How much they knew about her ! !
The woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own .
`` God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .
Come on now '' .
She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .
He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .
There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .
Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .
At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .
They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .
The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .
She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .
Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible .
She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .
The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty's flowers .
A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .
She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .
The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .
The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia .
Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .
They had white skins and blue eyes ; ;
all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .
A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .
Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .
Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .
She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall .
Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong .
Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about .
She had black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody .
She had been in Japan just one week .
It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ;
she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted .
Anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors .
There was nothing wrong with her job .
Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward .
There were no depressingly serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high .
At present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore , because the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours .
Tommy was interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients .
But she suffered in her off-duty hours .
Such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the Officers' Club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime .
She had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck .
This was one of the Navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world .
Ships from the West Coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet , and Yokosuka was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty .
Sooner or later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ;
if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long Beach .
And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there .
She felt , rather than saw , the approach of the good-looking young man .
He came through from the Fleet Bar , which was stag , with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried .
When he saw Tommy sitting alone , the tinkling sound stopped .
He was perhaps a trifle tipsy , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ;
he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant .
Probably off one of the carriers -- an aviator .
There was a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different .
Japan did something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas .
It was as if foreign duty implied and excused license ; ;
it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not ? ?
Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different .
`` Harro , girl-san '' ! !
He said , turning on what was meant to be charm .
`` You catchee boy-furiendo ? ?
Maybe you likee date with me '' ? ?
`` I beg your pardon '' ! !
Tommy said out of her cold rage .
`` I don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it '' ? ?
The nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing .
At least , he had the decency to blush , she thought .
`` Oh -- I'm sorry ! !
You see , I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' --
`` Oh , yes -- you had ideas '' ! !
Tommy interrupted furiously .
`` All wrong ones '' ! !
Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy slang .
`` Take off , fly-boy '' ! !
`` Uh -- sorry '' ! !
He muttered , and took off , obviously feeling like a fool .
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy .
She felt like a fool , too .
It hadn't been this way in college , or in nurses' training ; ;
it wasn't this way in the hospital at San Diego .
Everybody had accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl .
Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't American .
There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy Momoyama , brunettes with a Moorish hint of the Orient in their faces ; ;
there are beauties from the Balkan states who are similarly endowed , and -- back in the blessed United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women .
Now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being humiliated at every turn .
She looked around , self-consciously .
Four little Japanese waitresses were murdering the English language at the counter -- Yuki Kobayashi happened to be one of them .
Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` Bifutek-san '' ! !
For a steak sandwich , or `` Kohi Futotsu '' ! !
For one cup of coffee .
Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed .
One was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander ; ;
the other was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children .
Seeing these did nothing for Tommy's mood .
She told herself rebelliously , and with pride , I am an American ! !
And so she was , and would remain .
But she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English .
There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese .
Tommy wouldn't know ; ;
after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English .
One thing was becoming increasingly sure .
She had been sent to the wrong place for duty .
There was more to service in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in the ward .
One had to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours .
Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet Bar .
It was terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon .
She finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ;
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated .
Eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion .
Back in her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda , and sulked .
Then , after a while , she went to her mirror .
It was all true .
She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men .
And , still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach .
There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful .
She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of Oyajima -- which was not very far from Yokosuka .
And tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown .
Tommy , of course , had never heard of a kotowaza , or Japanese proverb , which says , `` Tanin yori miuchi '' , and is literally translated as `` Relatives are better than strangers '' .
Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water .
Doc Doolittle's scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report .
But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual , too , and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing .
Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know .
In his opinion , Doc had not grown up .
The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief .
There had never been a good reason for Doc Doolittle to grow up .
He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him .
The war found him much too early , and its perils -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes , and even now Doc had never found any stabilizing , sobering influence .
He remained young at heart , with an overdeveloped sense of humor .
He wisecracked about the captain's indoctrination of new men , took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches with ethyl chloride , and gave no thought for tomorrow .
He was doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him .
The job security enjoyed by Doc Doolittle , and nearly all members of the Armed Forces , is a wonderful thing .
Actually , all a man in uniform has to do is to get by .
He may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired .
Doc had been under restriction to the ship since the Bustard left Subic .
This deprived him of liberty in Hong Kong , but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong Kong was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day .
At Yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the Base because Walt Perry , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply Base .
This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well .
There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old shipmate .
A telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the Base exchange .
After supper , Doc called Whitey Gresham , who was now a lieutenant and had a family .
`` Well , Doc , you old sonofabitch '' ! !
Whitey exclaimed , with true affection .
`` Come over and have a drink .
We live down by the Base commissary .
Grab a taxi '' .
`` I'll be there , but I'll walk '' , Doc said .
`` I've got to run an errand on the way .
See you in about an hour '' .
He threw a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the Petty Officers' Club .
How , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ? ?
He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .
Then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted .
Perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years .
There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog .
Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark .
I could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ? ?
The telephone rang .
`` You missed it '' , Buzz's voice said , `` You should have gone over to the Pagan Room with us .
Wow .
Strippers , but scrumptious , and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band '' .
`` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said .
`` I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes '' .
`` Tough '' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday .
Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams '' .
He laughed and laughed .
Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners .
`` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' .
Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest .
When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door .
`` Yes '' , Owen called out .
`` Yes '' ? ?
`` I'm Mrs. Gertrude Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please '' .
Ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at last .
Probably saw me in the lobby .
He was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door .
She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons .
`` How do you do '' ? ?
She said , semi-professionally .
`` Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska .
We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light .
They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
`` You see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo '' .
`` Why is that '' ? ?
She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .
Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy .
There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye .
It gave her a lewd , winking effect .
`` Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo '' ? ?
She asked , winking wildly .
`` They are a very difficult group of people '' .
`` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' .
She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion .
`` You know , that's very interesting .
People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that .
The more canvassing I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God '' .
Forebearing , Owen kept his peace .
What would happen next ? ?
That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ? ?
Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice .
`` How did you get by the desk '' ? ?
He asked curiously .
`` I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers' doors and talking down Eskimos '' .
`` Oh , I just come once a week .
Every day I visit a different hotel .
I feel it's my duty .
I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters .
Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? ?
They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' .
`` Do you have any idea how far I travel every day ? ?
I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' .
Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself .
Mrs. Gertrude Parker drew back .
`` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she remonstrated .
`` You're in the secular world '' .
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen .
Not that religion isn't big business ; ;
those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don't get top personnel .
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' .
`` God , I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said waspishly .
`` God doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics '' , he said heatedly before he caught himself .
It sounded silly ; ;
why go on ? ?
More people were passing ; ;
he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation .
`` And whiskey '' , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses .
`` Don't forget whiskey ; ;
it's such a big seller '' .
`` You know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me .
I have an appointment '' .
`` I can imagine '' , she said .
`` Probably down at the bar .
But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ? ?
They must be freezing up there now .
Can't you help them '' ? ?
`` Leave a card or something .
I'll think it over '' .
`` I have no card '' , she said bitterly .
`` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you .
I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual bucking-up '' .
She looked crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race .
She stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ;
he heard her knocking on another door .
It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ;
then he realized he was hungry .
He showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast .
On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail .
There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued .
His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions .
He ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt braced .
He looked off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; ;
the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle .
He felt suddenly elated , adventurous .
With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot .
Although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the Golden Calf .
The tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded .
Just to test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars .
The way was opening up ; ;
when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach .
The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon .
There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot .
They all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up .
The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers .
The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful .
All , of course , except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death .
`` I wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen mused .
He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes .
She sighed a dirty word and left .
Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance .
She sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support .
A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .
He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .
`` What you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play .
`` You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' .
`` What are you playing '' ? ?
Owen asked .
`` I'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained .
`` I keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating .
But roulette's not my game .
I'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack .
Incidentally , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The Wrangler '' .
`` Nice to know you .
Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ? ?
`` Well , of course I do .
I'm with the Bar-H , pushing a horse called Sparky .
He's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on blackjack .
This Sparky can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County .
I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero .
I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson , but nothing like Sparky .
He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully '' .
Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars .
This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf .
When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards .
His adventurous spirit had waned ; ;
he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction .
He ogled a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a shill with her money in front of her .
He had no great prejudice against shills ; ;
it just seemed such a dry run .
There was no cash around ; ;
everyone was flipping silver dollars .
The management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points .
He read a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three A.M. starring Adele ( The Body ) Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls .
He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him .
He passed two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a little sad .
Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck .
Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses .
He was shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him .
`` We're all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva '' , Buzz explained , still instigating .
`` We ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel .
He started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading .
He was knocking down checks at faro '' .
`` I'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained .
`` Something about the pollen '' .
`` Well , okay '' , Buzz said .
`` We'll see you around later '' .
Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success .
`` How's your luck , honey '' ? ?
A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him .
She looked well-fed and prosperous , but he didn't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping .
`` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' .
`` Stake me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice .
I'll make them dance the tango .
We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .
`` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' .
`` If you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you '' .
`` Sounds like real love '' , Owen said .
`` It sort of brings a lump to my throat '' .
`` My name's Gisele '' , the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch .
`` Named after the ballet .
My mother wanted to call me Sylphide , but it sounded too affected '' .
Spencer said nothing .
`` Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense '' ? ?
Spencer shook his head .
Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' .
Spencer was quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain '' .
`` Very well '' .
Alexander walked away .
Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor .
Philip Spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address .
During the morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers .
Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him .
Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort .
The two met in the Captain's cabin .
`` What is the next step , Captain '' ? ?
`` More arrests , I fear '' .
In your opinion , who is this E. Andrews on the ' certain ' list '' ? ?
`` Cromwell , of course .
He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot .
He saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer .
Somehow he talked Spencer into letting him use another name '' .
There was a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain .
`` Have him come in '' .
Heiser , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places .
`` And also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely .
An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
McKinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that '' --
`` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ? ?
Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' --
He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him .
A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .
The aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror .
He bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction .
Adrien Deslonde hastened to Alexander's side .
`` Small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast .
I saw him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell .
I swear it , sir '' .
And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to obey .
Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .
Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed .
Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip Spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated .
When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers .
Spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal .
One of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after Midshipman Tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman Wilson .
Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon .
Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley .
Not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny .
In the tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen .
Three days had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .
Gansevoort said , `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely .
To have the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed .
From actions aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate '' .
`` Well '' , Heiser ventured , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' --
`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in .
`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .
Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ?
Then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order .
Mr. Heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ?
Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? ?
Wales said , `` Of course they would .
They are about to do so at any moment as it is .
All that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead .
As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed .
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
`` That is extravagant language , Mr. Wales .
We are not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said .
`` We are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound '' .
`` Of course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate .
The instinct of discipline has been lost .
Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand '' .
He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon .
Implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands .
And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' .
`` We ourselves must stand sentinel '' .
Alexander said .
`` Under arms day and night , watch and watch about .
Those of us present , the Perry brothers , Deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the Somers .
A great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' .
And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .
With all his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the Navy's implacable laws .
And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul .
Where had he failed ? ?
How had he failed ? ?
He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer .
It came to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven .
It was given or it was not given .
One did one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward .
One did one's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one's ship .
And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame .
God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career .
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .
It was for love that he had served the Navy .
To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for .
Now the hope was gone .
Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price .
Dear God , at what a price .
And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity .
Stern-faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .
The prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger .
Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful .
He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? ?
Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .
`` Are you , Cromwell '' ? ?
`` Yes , sir .
Before God I swear I am innocent .
I know nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing '' .
`` You are the only man aboard who can be in doubt '' .
`` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' .
He leaned closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck .
`` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' .
`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name .
You were careful about that '' .
Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke .
He said , `` Cromwell is telling you the truth .
He is innocent '' .
Alexander shifted his gaze to Spencer .
The calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell .
Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .
And in a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer .
Here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable .
There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth .
He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .
The red-haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer .
This tragic lad had forged his own shackles .
But he could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him .
And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain , they would be each other's undoing .
`` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? ?
He was your constant companion '' .
The hazel eyes met Alexander's .
`` I tell you he is innocent '' .
`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? ?
`` Yes .
I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .
`` Nothing to lose , either , Spencer '' .
`` That's true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation .
His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .
`` I am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again .
`` Before God , Captain , I am innocent '' .
And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell .
The boatswain was as guilty as any .
No action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell's hands while Spencer whispered explanations .
`` I thought '' , Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' .
It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him .
This was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized .
Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers .
Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah .
Bits of trash lay in the roadway .
The air smelled warmish and foul .
A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .
He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles .
His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high .
With his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead .
He had a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings .
I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road .
His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building .
Rachel had seen me watching the young man .
She smiled .
`` When your mother was here he must have been a young boy .
Like the ones you will see now '' .
I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel .
She led me into a twisting side alley .
The dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads .
Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings .
We entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor .
An old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black skullcap greeted us .
Rachel talked to him .
He nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me .
I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor .
His toes pointed out toward the walls .
He stopped in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom .
We stepped inside .
He left us .
Little boys crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher .
His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat .
One white hand poised a stick above his desk .
He turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish , `` One , two , three '' ! !
Rapping the stick against the desk .
The little boys shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation of the Five Books of Moses , which they had previously chanted in Hebrew .
They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .
Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of Europe .
The boys were tiny .
They had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces .
They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher .
Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction .
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped .
The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly .
One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles .
His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders .
In the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap .
His head barely rose above the table .
I stared at him for a long time .
He did not return my interest .
My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys .
Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago .
They singsonged the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick .
The tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake .
I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair .
His body pitched back and forth on the bench .
His front teeth were missing .
I shuddered and backed out of the room .
Rachel followed , looked at me , and clucked with her tongue .
We walked down the cool hall silently .
From behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer .
I said , `` How long do they keep that up '' ? ?
`` All day '' , she said .
`` Except for Shabbat , when they are praying all day '' .
I rubbed my hands together .
They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom .
The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps .
He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish .
Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' .
She passed by him .
I reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin .
Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man .
He thanked me .
I didn't look at him .
I grinned at Rachel .
`` Does this bother you '' ? ?
I said .
She smiled to herself .
`` Most of our Sabras think it's horrible .
When we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass .
They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' .
I was amazed .
You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home .
You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal .
And I wasn't .
I was American .
You had to know , also , that you were going to fail .
All of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place .
I resented them .
Rachel faced me .
Her bright eyes were twinkling .
She said , `` Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around .
Your mother hated this way of life .
She wished to change much for the children here '' .
I said quietly , respectfully , `` What did she do here ? ?
In this section '' ? ?
Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth .
`` Here , nothing .
But when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim .
She loved the children .
She was a strange woman , your mother .
When she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved .
Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted .
She stayed here to work for Aliah .
For many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your mother .
Sometimes it was dangerous for her '' .
Rachel grinned slyly .
`` But she loved danger .
She took it with her wherever she went ; ;
she chose it .
And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people .
She was most strange woman .
Ready to follow her impulse .
It was an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos .
Here they did not need to be in ghettos .
If she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms .
She set out to make sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this '' .
I said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` Then why did she leave Israel ? ?
I'd like to know that very much '' .
Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace .
The soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones .
She pursed her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me .
But she sighed and her face relaxed .
`` Trouble came into her life .
She had good friends here , people who liked her .
Who loved her .
But she had to go out and hurt herself .
There was a man here in town .
He helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted .
She worked very hard .
There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her .
He came with his son .
At first I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so .
This refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen .
He had the black numerals on his arm , so he had been branded in a concentration camp .
Yet he walked like a young man .
Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one .
Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe .
All his family was dead , except for his son .
Your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son .
He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him .
Then his son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the Mandate -- and the son was imprisoned .
A few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed .
She ran from a little group of us .
We were sitting together , talking .
She went to the father and found he had hanged himself '' .
Rachel paused .
It was silent in the stone alley .
Then she continued with energy , `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father .
No one saw her except the man Reuveni '' .
`` Yes '' , I said .
`` I know him '' .
Rachel gave me a direct , bright-eyed look .
She said , `` Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee .
He said she would only hurt herself .
He complained to me once that I must talk to her .
When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him .
I asked her if she would , and she said she would not .
He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him .
Anyway , I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself .
She came to me one day .
She was pale and skinny ; ;
she was terribly alone .
And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal .
He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself .
But now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her .
He would never let her harm herself again .
For one whole week he never let her stay alone .
She let him lead her around .
He took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was .
Reuveni took her with him wherever he went .
He did not let her talk to people ; ;
he did not let her choose her own food .
She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ;
she did not care .
`` And I'll take you with me '' .
The two of them against the world .
That had been how she imagined it .
For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too .
But now the dream was over .
The big waking up had happened .
`` What did I imagine '' ? ?
She thought .
`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot ? ?
Or maybe poling up the south fork of the Forked Deer River braving the wastes dumped in it ? ?
Maybe I saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it '' .
And I'll take you with me .
He had taken her all right .
Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .
Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving .
And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .
And Gratt Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .
Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would .
Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen .
Or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I'm pregnant '' .
You could wish that .
Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night .
So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help .
And every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too .
It is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull .
And most of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one .
He can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked .
And he can be on the way to Memphis , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead .
Because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him .
For you don't share him , not even with God .
If it is love , you don't .
And I'll take you with me .
Even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie .
Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you .
And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .
You feel him every mile further away .
You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't .
And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes .
You think : `` Did he feel that way about me '' ? ?
It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer ; ;
that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy .
It dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer's substitute , that other guy .
And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .
You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .
You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you .
`` Damn the world '' , she thought .
She looked out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds .
The mayor envisioned factories there .
Homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments .
The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .
The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City .
It was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing .
He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day .
So they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling .
If a man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever .
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too .
It was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it .
You laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm .
He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .
While he talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , rained enough to wet a rat's ass .
She glanced at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks , with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in August -- yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only June , only festival time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave her .
`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought .
Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .
There was no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock .
A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping .
The toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely .
She could not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall .
The two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot .
And the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor .
Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs .
Each of us had his own specialty besides .
George did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's glass .
He also drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , The New Yorker , for instance , or Esquire .
I did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .
The book could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration .
I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; ;
the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes .
I even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light reflections accurate .
McKenzie , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing doing , Rufus .
In the first place , it's static ; ;
in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ;
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold '' .
I said , `` Mr. McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it '' .
He said , `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think .
They know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy , and only the villains had beards .
And girls couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough '' .
In the end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie .
McKenzie was as happy as a clam .
`` That's authenticity '' , he said .
As for Donald , he actually sold paintings .
We all painted in our spare time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it .
Not much ; ;
he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends .
He had style , a real inner vision of his very own .
It was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults .
There was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye .
We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted .
It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting .
He also had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; ;
he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got Prussian blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well .
Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .
It was all gravy , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ;
none of us did .
We shared the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another .
Attending the life class was my idea -- or rather , Askington's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it .
I wanted to paint again .
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year .
It wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself .
It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting .
I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an illustrator -- like Peter Askington , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint '' .
Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; ;
I had admired him long before I talked to him .
It looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income .
The night we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; ;
instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade .
This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off's rent for a year .
He was fifteen years older than I -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle .
He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger .
He was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; ;
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month .
Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ;
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain .
I had a long talk with him .
We went into Mrs. Monmouth's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb .
The fireplace had tiles made for Mrs. Monmouth by Picasso himself .
Like certain expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself .
In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
I asked .
`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said .
`` I don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft .
Besides , it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as Durer went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna '' .
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
`` Painting isn't this big , you know .
It doesn't embrace only the artist , alone before his easel .
It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' .
He threw his arms wide , his face shining .
`` The artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic .
One of these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other .
The eye is all , inward or outward .
Ah , what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All '' ! !
`` What do you study '' ? ?
I asked .
I was fascinated ; ;
just listening to him made me feel intelligent .
`` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied .
`` Maybe you know him .
He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art '' .
I nodded .
I had studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on Hudson Street .
Burns and I had not loved each other .
`` I'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton '' .
`` Osric Pendleton '' ? ?
I said .
`` My God , is he still alive ? ?
He must be a million years old .
I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's '' .
`` Not quite '' .
Askington laughed .
`` He's about sixty , now .
Still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms .
He even makes the city look like one of Thoreau's hangouts .
I've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class '' .
`` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter '' ? ?
`` You're missing the point '' , he said .
`` He has the magical eye .
And he is a great man .
Contact with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
They lack stimulation .
They sit alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life .
That's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .
In the Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .
He was an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did .
He filled a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses .
He was a propagandist -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .
But look at us today ! !
We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity .
A bunch of amateur dervishes ! !
What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' .
He could certainly talk .
The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .
It was an awkward hour , but I didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .
After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work .
It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .
In a way , Askington was right .
`` Stimulating '' was the word for it .
I don't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be .
Partly , it was because Pendleton himself wasn't what I anticipated .
I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars .
No , that isn't quite fair .
Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .
Such a little thing to start with -- the car registration .
`` Ida , where is the car license '' ? ?
She asked .
`` I can't find it in the glove compartment '' .
`` Via must have it '' , I answered readily enough , recalling her last visit .
`` Via '' , she was frowning .
`` Why should Via have it '' ? ?
Had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? ?
I was silent .
I didn't want to stir things up .
`` I drive my own car by courtesy of Via '' ? ?
`` I'm sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather .
You know that '' .
She looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud .
`` She must have taken the registration when she went to Walter's .
I'll call her '' .
`` No , thank you .
I want nothing of Via's '' .
Why should this suddenly assail her ? ?
Walter was giving me checks for my pay , the household bills .
Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind ? ?
`` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly .
`` I knew all this , but I paid no attention .
I don't even own the house I'm standing in .
I was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things
`` It narrows down down down and finally there is no way out .
If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' .
I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in .
I love you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living .
So I went about my business .
I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
`` Don't bother , Ida '' , she said .
`` I have these appointments in town for Saturday , and I'll probably spend Sunday with Dolly or the Thaxters '' .
At last , I thought , she's recovering her spirits .
With this movie-to-be in London , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more tranquil , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here .
I felt more cheerful , as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself .
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life .
It was foggy that evening , but the path to my house was so well grooved that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days .
In the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on .
I did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town .
I did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon .
But the next day -- Sunday .
Why , when I drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear ? ?
Prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , unsee .
When I came back from church at noon Mrs. Thaxter was turning into the Salter driveway .
Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house .
Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us .
`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !
She screamed , and both women ran up to the house , and I followed .
The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps .
Everything was as I had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing .
And she .
Then the telephoning began .
I , who until that day before had been Mrs. Salter's friend , her equal , was the servant now .
It was Dolly and Mrs. Thaxter who were calling Via , everybody .
And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me .
And after I brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait .
Sitting in the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me .
`` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing '' .
Why didn't that alarm me then ? ?
And when she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was Harvie Harvie this , Harvie that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing '' ? ?
And then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself '' .
I had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check .
The last night I had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me .
I assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations with Dolly or Constance , she comfortable in bed .
But it seemed not from what they were saying .
Then was it a final desperate plea from her , to whom ? ?
Hanging on and on past any man's patience some final stab of conclusion ? ?
She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff .
I tried to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing .
Sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff .
It's so romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic .
With all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock , a misstep .
But I didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else .
When a fisherman brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to shudder with a terrible excitement , almost triumphant , that I still cannot account for .
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks ? ?
That at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ?
Or what was it that , before Via , Sonny , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it ! !
I knew '' ! !
Everyone stared at me and drew back .
Their eyes turned cold and accusing , even Via's .
And they have never changed .
At the same time that I thought I understood her at long last and pitied her , underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate , an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry ? ?
Was that what had given way in me ? ?
Even now I am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are .
It is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family I considered my very own , but there it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other .
At the time I was filled with self-pity at this separation , but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry .
In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne .
It is not their avoidance that rankles ; ;
it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so coolly and walk away , that it hurts .
I could tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body .
No , I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened .
She haunted me ; ;
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .
`` We all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly .
`` It was nobody's fault .
She overplayed her hand '' .
`` What do you mean '' ? ?
She frowned .
`` Why put such a high value on being top dog '' ? ?
I added .
It was coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see me since .
But suppose she had not taken Mrs. Mathias' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , dispossessed of love , hanging on to makeshifts , and altogether and finally arid .
If she chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her fullest height , and transcending her murky self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision ? ?
If they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions .
Yes , I had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt .
She was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice .
At rest with my darling Ellen , the first Mrs. Salter .
Mr. Salter came home .
The funeral service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed .
I waited .
Then Via called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had Ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning .
The coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses I had ordered .
I knelt , just for decency I thought at the time , but found myself whispering , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief .
Via was in the parking lot when I went outside .
Together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey .
By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths .
Again I felt impelled to kneel , and reached back and pulled Via down .
Something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her some healing .
`` I had a rather small place of my own .
A nice bachelor apartment in a place called the Lancaster Arms '' .
`` Uhhu '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid .
`` And then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio '' .
`` Uhhu '' .
`` I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him .
`` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people .
I think I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive .
But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .
Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .
She showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little .
`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ?
`` Me '' ? ?
She asked , turning slowly .
`` What about me '' ? ?
`` Did you make friends easily '' ? ?
`` Umm , uhhu '' .
`` Somehow I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot .
How about it '' ? ?
`` I guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse .
When she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror .
`` Are your people still alive '' ? ?
He asked , trying to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed ; ;
so he could have something of her for himself .
`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on .
`` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity .
`` You must have been good at history at school .
Where did you go to school '' ? ?
`` What is this '' ? ?
She asked , turning suddenly .
`` Don't you know all about me by this time ? ?
My name's Carla Caneli .
This is my town .
I sleep with you .
You know something more about me every day , don't you ? ?
Would you be happier if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies ? ?
Why are you trying to worry me '' ? ?
`` I'm not trying to worry you '' .
`` Well , all right then '' .
The cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .
At home he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance .
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ?
He wondered .
Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around ? ?
He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid .
If he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
She asked suddenly .
`` Nothing .
Nothing at all '' , he said quietly .
`` Let's go out '' .
`` Are those the only shoes you have , Sam '' ? ?
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
`` The heavy thick soles .
Look at them '' .
`` They're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot .
I like them '' .
`` Sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles .
Can't you get another pair '' ? ?
`` Maybe I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him .
`` I'll get an elegant pair of thin-soled Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla '' .
`` And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face .
`` What's the matter with it '' ? ?
He had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street .
`` Oh , Sam .
You look like a tweedy Englishman .
Can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged '' ? ?
`` I don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .
Changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good .
But it was a hopeful sign , he told himself .
She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli .
That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city .
They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via Veneto , then they went to the Farnese Gardens .
She had some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days .
Then they took a taxi to Trastevere .
`` There's a church you should see '' , she said .
And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto .
He let her tell him all about the church .
Then they had dinner .
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
When they got home at midnight she was tired out .
And in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing .
He had never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps .
It was a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought .
She might like to take him to St. Peter's .
`` Carla , wake up '' , he said shaking her .
`` It's ten o'clock .
Aren't you going out to mass ? ?
You could take me to St. Peter's '' .
`` Uhhu '' , she muttered .
`` Come on , you'll be late '' .
`` I think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church .
Why did he want her to go to church ? ?
He wondered Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .
It would be good for her .
It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church .
Not his poor mother's fault .
She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible .
As for himself , he just didn't have the temperament for it .
From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know .
Then he thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
Just figures out of a tribal folklore .
Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now ? ?
Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church .
It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself .
Or a Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist .
What was the matter with him that they all wearied him ? ?
It was the times , he was sure .
All the ideologies changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom ? ?
It was all too wearying .
Look somewhere else .
But where ? ?
Just the same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church .
A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass .
It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla .
`` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .
And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam .
There's so little to do '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
She said .
`` I'm not good at that kind of thing '' .
`` This afternoon let's take an air with them .
Let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking .
`` If you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair .
`` I am what I am .
I can't help it '' .
Her words remained with him , worrying him for hours .
He didn't know how she would behave with other people .
When they walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly .
`` Ciao , '' and put out her hand .
Her little brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things .
Agnese , smiling too , said , `` 'ello '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' .
And they sat down and began their little coffee party .
The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .
Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal .
She would turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again .
Watching her , he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth .
Signora Ferraro , bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest .
Carla translated .
The old woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway .
For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .
Did many of Sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? ?
Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ?
She wanted to know .
Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars .
Just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country .
And Sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope .
A very great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling .
An intellectual .
But very mystical too .
It was said that he had had a vision .
Just as thousands that day in Portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to Agnese for confirmation .
Agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware .
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes .
The Holy Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world .
Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint .
No , he was indeed a saint now .
Nodding approvingly and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially .
There was a certain discontent among the cardinals .
The Pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little .
There would be changes made , and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome .
Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent .
Did Signor Raymond understand ? ?
Indeed he did , Sam said solemnly , trying to get Carla's eye .
Surely she could see that these women were her Italians , too , he thought .
Devout , orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland .
But Carla's eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness .
And Carla , watching in wonder , turned to Sam .
`` It means so much to her .
It's like a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone .
But one night Dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where Shades of Night had gone to purify herself .
With the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips , making it whisper .
He saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her unhesitant fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach .
In her dark , scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding .
Seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart bounce in him , and turned away , afraid now .
Even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil presences in her metabolism more .
His breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off .
Going , he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs .
He cried out to her , his back turned .
Then he fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry .
But she heard him go .
Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp .
Elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters .
Early Spring came from her bed , from beside her half-drunk husband , Walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of hushed voices .
Standing there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her .
When at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl's scorn , she said in a voice overloud :
`` I shall call your father ! !
Go back where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! !
But the girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come '' .
And it was not Pile of Clouds she meant .
But now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , Early Spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried , `` I will not shriek at you ! !
I will tell you to go , not begging .
Telling you '' ! !
And unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side .
`` You bring only wickedness '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal .
Speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife .
`` Go take helsq'iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said .
`` They do not have to face battle .
I will not let your evil in .
I will simply kill you first .
Now go '' ! !
The other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt .
They picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl .
The sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs .
They were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought .
But she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly Pile of Clouds came howling among them , swinging a great bullhide whip .
`` Go back to your lodges '' ! !
He shouted .
`` A pack of dogs makes less noise '' ! !
He made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in their flight .
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
`` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter .
Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband '' ! !
But the old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand .
`` Get into your hovel '' ! !
He spat .
`` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
Keep him back , if you must tell me what to do .
I will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! !
She retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where Walitzee stirred , mumbling , sitting up in a half stupor to say :
`` What worrisome thing happens ? ?
I thought I dreamed of wolves fighting '' .
But she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from TuHulHulZote .
She said , `` There is nothing that concerns you here .
Lie back and go to sleep .
But do not dream .
Do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain '' .
He sank back , sighing , and was soon asleep again .
Outside , the old man , beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms .
And , shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face .
She said to him , her father , `` How was I begotten , in pain or joy ? ?
Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ?
They all know your foolish name '' ! !
She stared at the pale tracings on the tree , hearing her breath refracted from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark .
She felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning , like , `` unnnt ! !
Sssshoo '' ! !
The sounds of an animal in rage and despair .
Suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard Pile of Clouds say in his high , quavering voice :
`` Did you follow me to see my shame ? ?
Move from the line or I will settle the whip on you .
Move ! !
Do you hear the anger of the whip's whine '' ? ?
Turning , the girl saw Dookiyoon standing between , his narrow shoulders unbent , his arms hanging long and resigned .
He said , `` Let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too '' .
Then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry .
For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of TuHulHulZote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself .
He shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling .
He ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping draughts until finally , incoherent and sick , he fell into his own oblivion .
He amused the young men who had been silent long enough .
But they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics .
Now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them .
They came out and held their games and races .
It was they who held the future in their hands .
They went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons .
They danced the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal .
Walitzee was among them , and Sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing .
And a very young one , Swan Necklace , tried to emulate them and followed timidly .
Yellow Wolf was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked .
He would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices .
All the young men , Alokut among them , challenged them in matched racing .
They raced and maneuvered for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry .
At times they would ride frenziedly through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their regalia .
Then again they would stand in circles making other preparations .
They combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love .
Walitzee whitened his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees .
He saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow , hurtling with a mad grace , his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue .
He was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , admiring him .
And the suspicious , envenomed eyes of Pile of Clouds .
And those of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy .
He felt so much like laughing ; ;
even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs .
He and Sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men .
They would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance .
They would ride with streaming amulets , their colors ripening in the sun , shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death .
And so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts .
They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .
The ,
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening .
The sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , disheveled hoofs of the Appaloosas , horses the white men once had called the Dogs of Hell .
He saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge .
Standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , their hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them .
They leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war .
She was moving through a screen of hemlocks , in among the white birch and maples .
The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears .
She stood , once more listening .
She had never been here at this hour .
She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ;
but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ;
and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her .
If I ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days .
She smiled , and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves .
She jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and , seating herself , shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward .
The reedy music of the frogs had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was vibrant .
Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees .
She had accomplished a miracle .
This was her place .
The hour couldn't change it .
Only -- only -- her thoughts were a little strange .
They were becoming confused .
Perhaps it was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now .
She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago , in the Easter holidays , with her at one of those awful Friday Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her attend .
`` Hello , Julie , how are you '' ? ?
And then off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a lower-cut dress , someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him .
I wish he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment .
Oh God ! !
I wish I were older or younger , Julia Bentley thought .
I wish so much someone loved me .
George Rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- Millie , in a white robe , standing like a ghost at the threshold .
She had vanished ; ;
he must have slept again .
He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him .
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ;
but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning .
This room was like a prison .
He would not be indebted to Sam ! !
Below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner .
His fingers fumbled across the bandages .
They had left both of his eyes uncovered .
Well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road .
He was walking across to the bathroom .
He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands .
A fearful pain had come from his head , as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them .
He recognized his jacket and trousers .
The fabric was dark ; ;
the stains weren't too apparent ; ;
and there were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess .
He shivered , and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf .
Sam would be amazed to find him gone .
Millie would have to understand .
She must have put his clothes in the closet .
He found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness .
He was on the verge of tears .
Alex Poldowski -- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman .
At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying .
Perhaps George Rawlings would be better off dead .
What time was it ? ?
He peered at his wristwatch .
Strange , it was still running .
A quarter to seven .
Too early for a vacuum cleaner , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs .
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces .
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy .
He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door .
He barely knew himself .
This was some freak , two strands of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of gauze , suddenly moist over his cheekbones .
The surface , however , was perfectly white .
He was drinking another glass of water .
It was after seven o'clock .
He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall .
Who would take over ? ?
He'd have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about , and before Millie detained him with sympathy .
He entered the hallway .
He was actually walking down the stairs .
A plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away .
`` Father , is that you '' ? ?
The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below .
George did not reply .
`` Is that you , Father ? ?
Who's there '' ? ?
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered .
Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room .
She stood gazing at him .
`` Uncle George '' ! !
He was trying to smile at her .
`` Gosh ! !
You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ?
`` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie .
I'm all set .
Just about to call a taxi '' .
She was wearing some sort of gray blazer .
She seemed overly tall , her brow knitted in concern .
`` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying .
`` I'm about to leave myself .
I'll drop you off '' .
`` You're leaving '' ? ?
`` I'm going back to school '' , she answered .
`` Pietro's driving me .
I'm just finishing breakfast .
But have you told Mother you were going '' ? ?
She asked him .
`` No .
I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie .
That's my wish .
It's quite a big one '' , he added .
Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight .
`` Well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ?
Or maybe a drink '' ? ?
She asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful .
He tried to see her face more clearly .
`` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment's hesitation .
`` I'll just wait for you here '' .
He leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids .
He raised them .
Julia moved past .
`` I have to say good-bye upstairs .
I won't be long '' .
`` As a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me '' .
`` Not to anyone '' ? ?
`` No -- please .
`` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home .
It'll be so much easier '' .
`` All right '' She was staring at him .
`` I'm fine , Julie .
Please , you just go ahead '' .
She had disappeared .
He could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages .
He imagined Sam's voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? ?
I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought .
Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi .
He could hear the footsteps overhead .
He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding .
He stood up .
`` I'll take that , Julie -- for you '' .
`` Oh no '' , she said .
`` I can manage '' .
She went ahead of him .
Outside the Lincoln was parked .
He could hardly believe he was getting in .
Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion ; ;
but that didn't matter .
We'll drop Mr. Rawlings off in Ardmore '' , Julia said , and for the merest second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants .
To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ;
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed .
He could not stop to analyze .
He had never felt particularly close to her .
Carrie seemed more affectionate , but obviously Julia had respected his request .
He took her hand .
`` I wish I didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` I wish you lived in New York .
That's in the opposite direction '' .
`` I wish I did '' , he responded .
`` I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking .
`` Forget we ever knew what '' ? ?
`` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' .
She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace .
`` I know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say '' .
`` Does it '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Yes , perhaps .
I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ?
But sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business '' .
His voice seemed thick and purposeless .
He relinquished her hand .
He could see the stone building where he lived .
Just a few more steps .
Abruptly he reached into his pocket .
Yes , there was the key .
`` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ?
She asked him .
For a moment he smiled .
`` Yes , Julie dear .
You've done me the greatest possible service .
By myself I'll be fine '' .
`` Take care of yourself then '' .
`` I will .
You , also .
Don't work too hard '' .
It was an automatic phrase ; ;
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it .
He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! !
Will you look at George Rawlings ! !
What happened to you '' ? ?
`` I bumped into a door handle '' , George said .
Someone laughed .
George walked steadily ahead into his entry .
His bandages seemed on fire .
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it .
In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp .
Just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain .
He was telephoning .
`` No , Millie , I'm home .
No , really , right as rain .
Tell Sam not to worry about the car .
I'll get it hauled away .
No , please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep .
For God's sake , don't worry .
That upsets me more than anything .
Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist .
''
There was one more call to make .
`` Joan , did I wake you '' ? ?
He asked .
`` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up .
Look , sweetheart , some fool was .
Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night .
Unfortunately it turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss .
Oh hell no , I'm not in a hospital .
I won't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon .
Too bad a jury isn't involved .
I might struggle in for a jury .
I'd win hands down .
But I thought maybe Tony Elliott could pinch-hit for me .
He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge .
He's got all the facts .
I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement -- it's really just a routine thing .
What ? ?
No , darling I'd rather you didn't come out '' .
A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape .
`` Don't even send flowers .
I'll see you Wednesday .
I'll bribe you with a nice '' -- He was about to say `` double martini '' but thought better of it .
`` I'll take you out to dinner .
Okay ? ?
''
He had put down the receiver .
A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself .
Who knew about it ? ?
She lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed .
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor .
She was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary .
She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her .
In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ;
yet if he said : Make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her .
`` They make us conformists look good '' .
`` That's a peculiar way to think '' .
It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ;
she knew that .
It was Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra .
She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself .
`` Come , come '' , Jim said , jollying Lucy a little .
`` I love you .
Susan ready '' ? ?
Lucy listened .
Obviously , Susan was not .
Upstairs , busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room .
Susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a prudent soul ; ;
she always packed for a lifetime , just in case .
`` Not yet .
Every doll in the house must be going with her '' .
`` She'd better step on it .
It's a long way to Websterville '' .
Jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ;
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety .
`` You know '' , he said .
`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy .
It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' .
Lucy did not believe him ; ;
Myra appreciated nothing .
Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth .
`` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend .
`` She should have told me herself .
And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ?
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ?
Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ;
but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them .
Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra's husband , hadn't gone out to fetch her .
`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' .
For an otherwise silent moment , Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket .
`` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last .
`` You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time .
You'll see , Myra's settling down '' .
On the defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' .
`` It depends on the widow '' .
Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it .
And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down .
It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .
Remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered Cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon .
It was not that she disliked Cathy .
The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ;
whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra .
But Cathy was Myra's responsibility , not hers .
`` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' .
Myra loved big cities ; ;
thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother .
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .
`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! !
Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy .
He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` Susan ! !
Susan ! !
Get moving '' ! !
A startled piping sound returned .
`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said .
Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river ? ?
Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ;
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .
Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ;
Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line .
Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her .
His dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed .
`` Please '' , he said .
`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen .
Let's stay friends '' .
But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ;
they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage .
The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his .
Lucy was sick of it .
`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs .
Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ;
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls .
`` I'm ready '' , she announced .
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ?
Jim said .
His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment .
`` All that junk '' ? ?
Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ;
to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart .
`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully .
`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' .
She gave Jim a quick , shape-up look of warning .
`` She'll take every one of them '' .
Jim groaned , but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand .
And when you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you .
Nice '' ? ?
`` No '' , Susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect .
And at this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with Susan ; ;
there ought to be a limit to sharing , too .
That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit , short or long ; ;
the last one had been a Lilliputian war .
She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had .
`` Well '' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' .
When the car , with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust .
The day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it .
She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss .
She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that .
She turned and began to walk toward the house .
At the feeding station , the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered vestments .
The handsome bird was solitary ; ;
its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest .
She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ;
the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels .
Well , Lucy ? ?
She said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds .
She had a day of things to do ; ;
among them , she had to prepare the guest room .
How long would it be occupied ? ?
She wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness .
As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ? ?
For a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself .
It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests .
In the sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room .
There were new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze .
A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ;
since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed .
The closet was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes .
Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her .
Out in the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished .
When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there .
`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said .
`` I just thought I'd let you know .
Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago .
I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' .
`` I can imagine '' ! !
Susan was an active character ; ;
for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls .
Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ;
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her .
You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic .
`` How was Cathy '' ? ?
`` Subdued .
But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw '' .
On her way to the airport , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself .
`` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' .
There was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ? ?
`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' .
`` Well '' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life .
Puzzled , Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ;
her mother was forthright ; ;
she was not usually given to mysterious silences .
Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good ? ?
`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? ?
Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ?
Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? ?
Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do .
Just before Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near '' .
She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them .
`` Cathy was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' '' .
Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there .
Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake .
`` Christmastime ! !
'' Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ;
it was only too true .
Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks .
For a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it .
`` That does it '' ! !
She said .
`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks .
Then , if Myra does nothing about fetching her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself '' ! !
Her hand tightened on the receiver .
`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' .
For Lucy , the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end .
As she hung up , she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings , and heard their grotesque singing .
Cowbird Myra ! !
She's not going to get away with it .
Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path .
The child's thin legs were plodding .
She trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear .
She was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house .
Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;
the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had .
Lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ;
they would have to buy things for her .
She opened the door .
Unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand .
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving .
For eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before Esperanza Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards .
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced .
They walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` Eats '' sign jiggling in the wind .
Now they were in friendly territory .
Nobody around .
Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge .
His rock was to the right of a V-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers .
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .
Here he was enclosed and safe .
( If a dragon or a sea monster came along , didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew ? ?
)
Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe .
He was Canute controlling the waves .
He was a knight of the Round Table , `` Sir Quintus the Brave '' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses .
( One good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show .
) He was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature .
He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to .
Fearless .
Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ?
A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad .
He hadn't intended to make the promise .
It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America .
Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ;
and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint .
It's all right .
Stop shaking '' .
He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar .
`` Let's talk about the beach .
Son .
While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ?
Look , I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck .
Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg .
He says you're limping more than you need to '' .
`` How does he know ? ?
Big dumb nut .
He never had polio '' .
In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out .
`` You just wait , Dad .
When you get back I'll probly be swimming better than Victoria .
Wait and see , Dad '' .
Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach .
He called her `` Fatso '' .
She called him `` Stuck-up -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister Stuck-up '' .
Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' .
`` She's got a nerve '' .
Quint said now to the clouds .
Strength began to zip up and down his chest .
He felt strong as a giant .
He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .
`` Goolick , goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull .
`` Aw , shut up '' , he said .
He stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean .
The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves .
I can't go in .
I'm scared of the nightmare .
Shivering , he put on his clothes .
And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water .
`` Watch it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back .
She was holding on to his rock with one hand .
She smelled of peppermints .
She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no straps on the shouders .
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ?
He snapped .
`` This is my rock '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
She was sore as a boil .
`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ? ?
`` Sure .
They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' --
`` Mister Big Britches , aren't you '' ? ?
`` I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth .
They call me Quint '' .
`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ? ?
`` I said Quint .
That's short for Quintus .
Quintus in Latin means '' --
`` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart aleck '' .
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping .
`` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice .
`` I don't smoke '' .
She was horrified .
`` Do you '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes '' .
Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum .
`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' .
`` If I was your mama , I'd wop your tail off '' .
`` My mother never wops me .
I've got this leg brace '' .
She seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace .
`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said .
`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ? ?
`` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always .
Dr. Fortman says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' .
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air .
`` A cane's mighty handy .
Someone's walking past , you want to stop him , zoooop , snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane .
Or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is bannnnnng , stooooomp your cane on the floor .
Hey , will you look at that '' ? ?
Maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail .
`` That's some dog .
What kind '' ? ?
`` Part collie , part wire-haired terrier '' .
Quint glared .
He always did when people asked .
`` Holy mackerel , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly .
`` His real name's DiMaggio , only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers .
He's braver than he looks .
He's been sick lately .
Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag '' .
`` A what '' ? ?
He would have told her , but Victoria was yodeling .
That meant `` Mama wants you Quint .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
`` I gotta go .
Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes .
I come early in the morning '' .
`` So do I .
See you around , Mister Squint '' .
That was how they started being friends .
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .
Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ;
it made her blister .
Her name was Sabella , and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying love .
`` You going to marry the King '' ? ?
`` No .
He's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork .
My hair is what he's nuts about .
Naturally curly hair runs in my family .
Personally , I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the Continent , ' What can one do ' '' ? ?
`` Which continent '' ? ?
`` Name one , I been there '' .
Japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ;
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup .
Pugh .
Camels in Tripoli had harelips .
Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .
As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ;
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them .
`` Really '' .
Quint smothered a yawn .
She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so .
Artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War ; ;
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ;
that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia .
`` Books are for schnooks '' .
She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear .
Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella .
( `` What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ?
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .
And `` What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist ? ?
Tooth-hurty '' .
) Encouraged by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham .
He described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch .
He snuck up on the ham like Maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it .
That dog has to go '' .
`` Say , you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said admiringly .
`` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ? ?
He hadn't .
But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .
`` Either that or a veterinarian '' .
`` Better make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said .
`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' .
Sometimes they argued .
She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward .
His encylopedia agreed with Sabella .
Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around .
Boy , could she catch ! !
Like Willie Mays in the outfield .
`` Nobody gave me flowers before .
Thank you , Quint '' .
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough .
`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok '' .
Sometimes they didn't talk at all .
He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around .
Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared .
But Victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints .
As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time .
Wednesday morning it happened .
They were eating breakfast .
`` We beseech thee , Lord Gord , to bless this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib .
Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement .
`` Your Daddy's in San Francisco '' , she told them .
`` He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane .
Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ?
`` Yeah , keen '' .
A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach .
`` Children , we'll have to get organized .
The baby can have an early nap .
Victoria , I want you to -- ''
Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared .
`` Hurry up , we're late '' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and Kool-Aid green .
The cave in his stomach hurt .
He had to go into the water .
He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare .
It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .
What caused it , he didn't know .
The metal collar gagging his neck ? ?
Sweating so much ? ?
The unbearable weight on his chest ? ?
All of it together meant drowning .
The first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second .
When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car , the Jaguar his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an afternoon's golf at Oakmont , it seemed to mark the end of a long , miswritten chapter in the social life of the community .
Linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath .
Not that Linda was heartless , not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would .
Hadn't Linda been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? ?
Wasn't John Cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ?
And wasn't John's wife , Edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ?
Didn't John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ?
Wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ?
And romantic ? ?
Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound .
It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his .
`` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart .
`` Poor John '' ! !
Linda accepted the reproach , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the Allegheny Mountains , and John was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around Pittsburgh .
For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs .
John had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of Dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes .
You saw them always together those years .
You talked about John-and-Linda as an entity .
John-and-Linda were at Longue Vue last night ; ;
John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut in three and a half hours .
Then there was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ;
only this one didn't heal .
You still said `` John-and-Linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or Dillinger .
It got worse instead of better .
First , it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more .
And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans .
There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John .
He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did .
Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers .
It wasn't even John and Edythe .
It was simply Poor John .
There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either .
Mousie Chandler had been to school with her someplace near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at Horne's .
`` Well , you shouldn't underestimate Edythe '' , Mousie said .
`` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained .
She is frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn't shallow '' .
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding .
John was at the church with Edythe .
She giggled during the ceremony , and Mousie Chandler , who was one of Linda's bridesmaids , said John glared black as death at her .
`` As if he were choking '' , she said .
`` Poor John '' ! !
Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example .
Her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length .
She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart .
And you didn't see her much at Longue Vue or anywhere , for John had drifted away from the gang .
Mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity .
Others thought he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything .
There were less-dramatic reasons too .
John's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left .
John sold the big old place in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel .
He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day .
John was good at his job .
It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to .
Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of Edythe .
But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made Edythe's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring .
She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda .
When there was bridge at Edythe's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers .
She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' .
John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries .
Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile .
Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one .
He was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him .
But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ;
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company .
The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary .
Bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money .
He and Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year .
And then came the hairpin turn , the smashed Jaguar and Linda , mourning alone and lovely .
Everyone held his or her breath .
`` Don't think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , Mousie Gordon , who had been Mousie Chandler , said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at Le Mont .
`` Now you know she could've , but she isn't that kind of girl .
But now -- well , it would be a blessing , I think .
Poor John '' .
Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling .
What she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death .
She knew what people were thinking ; ;
it was what she had been thinking herself .
It was up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to undo the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream .
There was no one who would blame her or John ; ;
she could be sure of that .
It might be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her , to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere .
And Linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own .
It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of .
Linda would have to wait , she knew .
But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ?
Years of watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead .
Of course , he had done wonders .
Alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at Smith & MacIsaacs , where John and Bobbie both worked .
Bobbie had been head of the alloy division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch .
So when old Mr. Lovejoy , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with Carnegie-Illinois , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie .
For Linda knew how to help her husband , not just the Stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy .
She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job .
`` What did you do '' ? ?
She asked Bobbie .
`` You must have done something , something wrong .
Lord knows I had everything set for you '' .
Bobbie said something about damned Pittsburghers sticking together , and Linda got angry at him .
They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk .
Linda dragooned her uncle , Donald Murkland , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened .
He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision .
But jolly old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand .
He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other .
`` I'm behind John Cooper '' , Mr. Lovejoy said finally .
`` I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive .
`` Now , I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder .
With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance .
Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities .
And also , the money can't mean as much to Bobbie .
`` Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ;
Poor John will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us '' .
Most of the directors nodded .
Uncle Donald Murkland found himself nodding agreement too .
After the surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to move to Funk Furnaces .
The job at Funk wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being subordinate to John and assured him steady advancement , since Funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of Linda's family .
Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric .
When he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future .
She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night .
`` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money .
Such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' .
`` That's swell '' , I said sweetly .
I could get along without that three dollars .
In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine ! !
It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang .
I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour .
I answered to find Nadine at the other end .
`` You scared me half to death '' , I said shakily .
`` What's wrong '' ? ?
`` Janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! !
Her voice came shrill .
`` I'm absolutely frantic ! !
That stupid girl might have gone off and left Francie '' ! !
`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said .
`` She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone .
But if you're worried you can go home and check '' --
`` I can't leave the party ! !
We're at Ken Thom's apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! !
Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' --
I was all set for what came next .
`` Janice , could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right ? ?
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' --
`` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as I said it , why I should make it at all .
Why should I go over at midnight to check on Francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ?
`` Fifteen minutes , then ! !
Please , Janice .
I'll be glad to pay you '' --
So sure that money could do anything ! !
`` All right '' , I said .
I'd do it .
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me .
But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? ?
Chris was sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him .
I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .
I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door .
Her face was flushed from sleep .
`` It's all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared .
`` Mrs. Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you .
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
`` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she faltered .
She didn't look over thirteen .
And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! !
`` I have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on .
`` I didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! !
The phone started ringing .
`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said .
`` I'll answer it '' .
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home .
`` Janice , would you mind staying '' ? ?
There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying .
`` Wally's drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want Shirley to see him like this .
You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' --
Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done .
The receiver clicked in my ear .
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse .
Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! !
But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk .
So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment .
After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited .
I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices .
Nadine's , shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two .
I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him .
I had always thought she was so beautiful .
But now she looked ugly .
Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead .
`` Pack your clothes '' , she hissed .
`` Pack -- and get out '' ! !
`` You're crazy '' , Wally said thickly .
He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep .
Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face .
I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy .
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me .
`` He's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! !
He insulted Ken Thom '' ! !
Her eyes were wild .
`` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! !
And the other people there were listening ! !
We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' --
`` you'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously .
I was plenty scared .
In the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! !
`` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' --
`` Tea , '' Nadine screeched .
`` How can you be so damn stupid ? ?
Wally's lost his job ! !
Ken will never forgive him -- never ! !
And we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime ! !
All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them .
And we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours -- and all because of that '' --
I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth .
`` Stop that ! !
You'll wake up the whole building .
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' --
`` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain .
She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning .
`` You go to bed '' , I said curtly .
`` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' --
She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped .
I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out .
It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go .
I left her , a limp bundle of self-pity , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her .
Wally was snoring on the davenport .
I had done all I could .
I had done all I was going to do .
Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine .
I drove home , found Chris still asleep .
I snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him .
Thankful I wasn't Nadine .
I kept on being thankful .
In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie .
Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry .
`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much .
I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' --
Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired .
Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .
Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him .
`` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably .
`` But Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises .
And I was plastered and I blew my stack '' --
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! !
I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there .
But she was beyond caring what she said .
`` Things may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern .
But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved .
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough .
When A bubble breaks , there's nothing .
Little by little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived .
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned .
On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted .
Worst of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work .
He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded .
Chris fretted .
`` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' .
I said I wished we were , too .
It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent .
But Chris brightened up like a candle .
`` I'm glad you feel that way , honey .
There is one big way we can help them .
We can let them move in with us '' --
Something I had simply never thought of .
Something so incredible --
I just stared at him .
It was incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look .
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded .
But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' .
Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money ! !
`` I won't do it '' , I said flatly .
`` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! !
Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! !
`` That isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said uncomfortably .
Then I felt uncomfortable , too .
I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter .
But , darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us ? ?
But , in the end , we did .
It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do .
The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name .
Then Wally got sick .
To my way of thinking , he was scared sick .
His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world .
Chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special .
At least we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away .
While I worked , Nadine sat and cried .
When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally .
`` Virus infection nothing '' , she'd scream at him .
`` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job .
You're just a no-good bum '' ! !
It was a mess , all right .
But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said .
I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks .
But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us .
Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed .
He set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of alibis and excuses .
Wendell Thom had black-balled him .
Nobody would even take his application .
`` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap .
`` You can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else '' .
`` The high school kids have got everything sewed up '' , he said , a whine in his voice .
`` Those damn punks -- taking work away from men who need it '' .
`` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging .
But this was only the middle of July .
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this .
I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .
I don't really believe in intuition .
But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day .
Part of it was the weather , so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital .
Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late .
But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all .
It was just going to be one of those days .
For the thousandth time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession .
And for the thousandth time , I answered myself .
I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me .
Actually , I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror .
I had a lot to be thankful for .
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at .
Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home .
At least , we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was .
I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it .
Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out .
Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been .
But I mustn't start on Alice .
She is a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at .
If she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow
As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .
Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me .
It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too .
Oh , I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision .
I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson , the most promising intern at Fairview , had something to do with it , too .
She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little .
But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned .
If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking .
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ?
Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years ? ?
The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview .
Two interns and Dick Ishii , the other resident .
I'm Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds .
Pete was down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there .
There wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one sicker than they should have been .
Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of post-operative shock , but it was all taken care of now .
Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then .
When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor .
`` Got a new one in last night '' , he said .
`` I haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a lulu '' ! !
I wasn't surprised .
The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics .
We didn't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights .
It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward .
The moment I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed .
They'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk .
But there was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name .
Alice But this woman's name was Rose Bancroft ! !
I looked at the chart for reassurance .
Yes , Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism .
She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four .
An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry .
Her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray .
Oh , could it be ? ?
No , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and I turned to Dick , forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind .
In a low voice , Dick filled us in
she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway .
Although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out .
It was the old story .
We'd keep her a day or two , and the AA people would talk to her .
But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left .
Turning toward the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick .
I tell you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak .
`` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft '' ? ?
I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , I've always thought , to chat first .
This was one time I'd have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong .
`` Hey '' ! !
Her voice was flat and dull .
But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away .
It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed .
There were bloodspots on the sheet .
`` What's this '' ? ?
I asked .
`` Your period '' ? ?
She shook her head .
`` I been spotting a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice .
`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ?
Once again , there was a negative shake .
I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table .
`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete .
It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination .
Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear , sent it down to the lab with a request for the test .
That done , I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind .
I was busy the rest of the day .
Late in the afternoon , I was up on Seven again .
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled .
On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete .
`` I've got the results on the Bancroft smear test '' , he said .
`` There's something there , all right .
Class Three , they said .
Do you want to talk to her , Doctor '' ? ?
`` Well '' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again .
But that was ridiculous , of course .
`` All right .
We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy .
Maybe it's nothing , maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ -- can't take any chances '' .
`` If you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said wryly .
`` Groggins tells me she's started badgering already , wants to get out .
Wants to get to her booze , I guess '' .
I grimaced in distaste .
`` Well , better see what I can do '' .
We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar .
But she seemed to be dozing and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones .
Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward shiver .
`` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said .
`` I just got through seeing one of you guys .
What do you want '' ? ?
There was something almost insulting in her tone , but I disregarded it .
`` I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson '' , I said .
`` We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage .
That's quite minor , nothing to worry about .
But we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary '' .
`` No '' .
It was flat , definite .
`` Suppose you let me explain .
Actually , I rather doubt that we'll have to do this .
Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' .
I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor .
`` No '' .
I looked at her in amazement .
I'd had patients who'd refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why .
Mostly , it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet .
`` Will you tell me why '' ? ?
I asked .
She smiled , a smile without humor .
`` You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said .
`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?
She went on , disregarding my protests .
`` I'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs .
Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor .
Just let me die in peace '' .
I stared at her , almost speechless .
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was .
Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone .
This was someone who'd come down in the world , I thought .
A long , long way down .
Again there was something familiar about her , something --
`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could .
`` I don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? ?
And even if '' --
`` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe '' .
I gaped at her .
She could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult .
But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke .
She was watching me intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips .
`` Surprised , baby ? ?
Guess I've changed , haven't I ? ?
But you haven't changed much , Joe '' .
I knew then , knew with a heart-stopping shock .
`` Alice '' -- I stammered through dry lips .
`` Alice , for goodness sake '' --
`` Alice '' , she echoed mockingly .
`` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of me ? ?
Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ?
Well , don't worry .
Just let me outta here '' --
`` But why did you come back '' ? ?
I'd found my voice .
`` Where have you been all these years '' ? ?
She shrugged .
`` Here and there .
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to .
The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' --
The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout , made me shudder .
And this was Gladdy's mother ! !
`` I never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now .
Let me outta here ! !
You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ?
No , I want out , Joe '' ! !
I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me .
Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ?
What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me .
If I let her go , she'd disappear once more .
And Gladdy would be safe ! !
I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .
She made me welcome .
Her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's ; ;
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic .
yielding-Mediterranian-woman- , she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her .
I no longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting drunker , happier and more contented by the second .
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now .
Only the dive itself had any meaning .
The metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water .
Perhaps if I took off the aqua-lung I could swim better , love my woman better .
I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out .
While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time .
It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris .
It was no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull .
I knew it wouldn't be the same .
Wild kicks never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind .
Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery .
That first time was good and it stuck with me .
I was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main .
It was a Saturday evening in April with a mist-like rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life .
I had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night .
In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees in a fresh uniform .
I felt like a Hun in Rome .
All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ;
everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes .
There were some sweet machines other than women : an old Bugatti , a lean Farina coachwork on an American chassis , a Swallow , a type A40-AjK Mercedes and lots more .
There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel -- I was no yokel , but I was young , and this was Paris ! !
I had champagne at Maxim's , then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre .
I never got there .
I met Claire , which was better .
She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine .
I stared .
I didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful .
She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress .
Maybe her ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it .
When she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said :
`` Handsome soldier , I have assuaged one hunger with food .
I feel another of terrible urgency .
Is your evening free '' ? ?
`` Madame '' , I said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' .
And so off we went to her apartment .
She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl .
Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese .
Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned .
I got there on a Saturday evening .
I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit .
The place was busy but I didn't feel like a Hun .
I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up .
I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg .
After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was crocked .
I went to my hotel and slept .
The next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ?
So I drank more cognac .
All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .
I read the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer .
Elemental , but sex .
That's what was on my mind .
I was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off .
I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up .
My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others .
A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value .
Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing .
I went out into it .
I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky .
There was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night .
I had on only a topcoat , but I wasn't cold .
I was just miserable .
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick .
She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away .
Suddenly I understood why she had the umbrella .
It gave her poise and posture .
Without it she would have been drab and limp .
It gave her propriety .
It gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle .
I couldn't imagine her without it .
I knew all about her .
She was another human being and happened to be a hustler .
I didn't much care if she were there or not .
After a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears '' .
( I didn't have on a hat .
)
Hardly glancing at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone .
She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ?
`` I'm not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow .
She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn't want it .
`` Is it a woman '' ? ?
She asked gently .
She must have seen the ring on my left hand .
`` Well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , I observed profoundly , adding , `` You can wager your derriere on that '' .
`` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to wager it .
''
This took me so funny I had to look at her .
I felt my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped .
I even snorted a chuckle .
She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile .
She was even more miserable than me .
Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them .
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ?
She asked .
Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ?
I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
Anyway , I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her .
I could see she was shocked .
`` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said .
`` Non , non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' .
She tilted up and drank , and then I drank .
It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before .
I wasn't going to lug around a glass .
There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well .
No child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty .
I couldn't be sure .
Somehow she was attractive .
Not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive .
I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there .
We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .
I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it .
We seemed to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell .
Then she said , `` Allons '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word .
I sensed no stranger in her .
We undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery .
I decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age .
She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side .
I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted .
I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy .
My head was clear .
I was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital .
`` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips .
She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up .
Maybe closer to thirty , I thought .
`` Bon jour '' ! !
She exclaimed , smiling .
`` J'ai faim '' ! !
`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' .
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .
I called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her .
She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my robe .
I had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast .
`` The toothbrush Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it .
I gave it to the woman .
`` What is this for '' ? ?
She asked innocently .
`` Why , to brush your teeth '' .
`` But I already have ! !
I used yours '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
I said with round eyes .
I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself .
But I smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live dangerously , I decided I would scald my worries away .
The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good .
We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread .
As we ate , we talked .
Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen .
We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee .
`` You are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked .
`` Um '' ? ?
I grunted , sipping .
`` Yes , because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush '' .
I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror .
`` I didn't really use yours '' , she went on .
`` I carry one in my purse .
I know men never kiss les putains '' .
To my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the Louvre today '' ? ?
`` All right '' .
I said with enthusiasm at the idea .
`` But not immediately '' .
I put aside my empty cup .
She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own .
We were not rushed .
`` What is this from '' ? ?
I asked , touching the scar on her stomach .
It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle .
`` A bullet '' , she answered .
The cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all .
She understood sex anyway , and played at it well .
We went to the Louvre for a few hours , then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre .
It was a nice place , not filled with smoke .
We had champagne and steamed mussels .
The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered .
He must have thought I was a tourist .
I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for ? ?
I didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' .
I thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh .
Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag .
She would not stop to read them in American Express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street .
This was her first day in Rome and it was June .
An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead .
In her mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills .
Pictures in old Latin books returned to her : the Appian Way Today , the Colosseum , the Arch of Constantine .
She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight .
Moreover , nursing various Stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses ( everybody could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot .
England , France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes .
The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go .
There's nothing to stop me now .
So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly noisy .
In the street the traffic was really frightening .
Cars , taxis , buses , and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain .
Shoals of tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed Americans looking in shop windows .
Glad to be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left .
The Spanish Steps .
Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants .
She had heard about it the night before at her hotel .
It was not yet complete : workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above .
The azaleas were as large as shrubs , and their myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too .
Marvelous , thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything .
In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed .
Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down .
Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun .
Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air .
The sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches .
She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette .
Content excited ; ;
how could you be both at once ? ?
Strange , but she was .
Presently , she picked up the first of the letters .
A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay .
Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! !
Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? ?
And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ?
She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her .
Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady's script -- t's carefully crossed , but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope .
Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor .
No return address whatsoever .
Somebody had scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna ? ?
, across the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope .
Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway .
Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago .
Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died .
I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh .
This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it .
She refolded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George .
But alas George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral .
He was full of heavy family reminiscence .
All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today .
His own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all .
A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand .
Poor George ! !
The only boy , the family darling .
Together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong .
Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George .
Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ?
As for Cousin Alexander Carraway , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George .
There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot .
He had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool .
He held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey .
They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .
`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
She kept repeating .
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
`` You might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa .
`` Drop a cold key down his back '' .
`` I just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best .
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said .
He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused .
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .
Now , here they both were , still the same , George full of round-eyed woe , and Cousin Emma in despair .
Theresa shifted to a new page .
`` Of course ( George's letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered .
Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it .
Robbie and Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our Rosie is still in high school .
The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is populated with -- Miss Edna Whittaker , for example .
But there is more in this than meets the eye .
A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in .
The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off .
'' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house .
) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .
I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best .
''
I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick .
I'll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps .
She got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men .
They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick .
Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so .
Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits .
`` No '' , said Theresa .
`` No , no '' ! !
She said .
The man did not wish to leave .
He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them .
Carrozza rides in the park , the Colosseum by moonlight , he specialized .
Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two .
There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone .
Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered .
The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ;
at last , alarm .
She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! !
Finally , she scurried away up the steps .
Theresa Stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma .
They were even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September .
Of course , it wasn't Anne and George's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa ? ?
The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist .
They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow .
It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation .
It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore .
She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other .
Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two .
`` Signora '' ? ?
She became aware that two Italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display .
`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma .
''
`` Oh put it there '' ! !
She indicated a spot a little distance away .
I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer .
You can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus .
And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren .
Just as it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that .
Susan Dolan , that's me .
They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission .
I never heard my folks talk about her , though .
They were good-living religious people , and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody .
Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me .
My folks and my faith protected me from things like that .
And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren .
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
I asked him if it was true .
He gave me a straight , honest answer .
`` Look , Sue baby '' , he'd said .
Much as I love you -- well , a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to -- to come across .
Honest , kitten , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' .
